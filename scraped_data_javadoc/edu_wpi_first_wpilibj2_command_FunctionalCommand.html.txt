Command
A command that allows the user to pass in functions for each of the basic command methods through
 the constructor. Useful for inline definitions of complex commands - note, however, that if a
 command is beyond a certain complexity it is usually better practice to write a proper class for
 it than to inline it.
This class is provided by the NewCommands VendorDep
