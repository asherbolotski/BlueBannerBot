getTopic
()
Get the corresponding topic.
Specified by:
getTopic
in interface
PubSub
Returns:
Topic
get
T
get
()
Get the last published value. If no value has been published or the value cannot be unpacked,
 returns the stored default value.
Specified by:
get

Supplier
<

Returns:
value
get
T
get
(
T
defaultValue)
Get the last published value. If no value has been published or the value cannot be unpacked,
 returns the passed defaultValue.
Parameters:
defaultValue
- default value to return if no value has been published
Returns:
value
getInto
boolean
getInto
(
T
out)
Get the last published value, replacing the contents in place of an existing object. If no
 value has been published or the value cannot be unpacked, does not replace the contents and
 returns false. This function will not work (will throw UnsupportedOperationException) unless T
 is mutable (and the implementation of Struct implements unpackInto).
Note: due to Java language limitations, it's not possible to validate at compile time that
 the out parameter is mutable.
Parameters:
out
- object to replace contents of; must be mutable
Returns:
true if successful, false if no value has been published
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException
- if T is immutable
getAtomic
TimestampedObject
<
T
>
getAtomic
()
Get the last published value along with its timestamp. If no value has been published or the
 value cannot be unpacked, returns the stored default value and a timestamp of 0.
Returns:
timestamped value
getAtomic
TimestampedObject
<
T
>
getAtomic
(
T
defaultValue)
Get the last published value along with its timestamp If no value has been published or the
 value cannot be unpacked, returns the passed defaultValue and a timestamp of 0.
Parameters:
defaultValue
- default value to return if no value has been published
Returns:
timestamped value
readQueue
TimestampedObject
<
T
>[]
readQueue
()
Get an array of all valid value changes since the last call to readQueue. Also provides a
 timestamp for each value. Values that cannot be unpacked are dropped.
The "poll storage" subscribe option can be used to set the queue depth.
Returns:
Array of timestamped values; empty array if no valid new changes have been published
     since the previous call.
readQueueValues
T
[]
readQueueValues
()
Get an array of all value changes since the last call to readQueue. Values that cannot be
 unpacked are dropped.
The "poll storage" subscribe option can be used to set the queue depth.
Returns:
Array of values; empty array if no valid new changes have been published since the
     previous call.
