Class for mecanum drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the robot's position on the field
 over a course of a match using readings from your mecanum wheel encoders.
Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like path following.
 Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation when using computer-vision systems.
