getCubicControlVectorsFromWaypoints
public static
Spline.ControlVector
[]
getCubicControlVectorsFromWaypoints
(
Pose2d
start,
Translation2d
[] interiorWaypoints,
Pose2d
end)
Returns 2 cubic control vectors from a set of exterior waypoints and interior translations.
Parameters:
start
- The starting pose.
interiorWaypoints
- The interior waypoints.
end
- The ending pose.
Returns:
2 cubic control vectors.
getQuinticSplinesFromWaypoints
public static
QuinticHermiteSpline
[]
getQuinticSplinesFromWaypoints
(
List
<
Pose2d
> waypoints)
Returns quintic splines from a set of waypoints.
Parameters:
waypoints
- The waypoints
Returns:
array of splines.
getCubicSplinesFromControlVectors
public static
CubicHermiteSpline
[]
getCubicSplinesFromControlVectors
(
Spline.ControlVector
start,
Translation2d
[] waypoints,
Spline.ControlVector
end)
Returns a set of cubic splines corresponding to the provided control vectors. The user is free
 to set the direction of the start and end point. The directions for the middle waypoints are
 determined automatically to ensure continuous curvature throughout the path.
Parameters:
start
- The starting control vector.
waypoints
- The middle waypoints. This can be left blank if you only wish to create a path
     with two waypoints.
end
- The ending control vector.
Returns:
A vector of cubic hermite splines that interpolate through the provided waypoints and
     control vectors.
getQuinticSplinesFromControlVectors
public static
QuinticHermiteSpline
[]
getQuinticSplinesFromControlVectors
(
Spline.ControlVector
[] controlVectors)
Returns a set of quintic splines corresponding to the provided control vectors. The user is
 free to set the direction of all control vectors. Continuous curvature is guaranteed throughout
 the path.
Parameters:
controlVectors
- The control vectors.
Returns:
A vector of quintic hermite splines that interpolate through the provided waypoints.
optimizeCurvature
public static
QuinticHermiteSpline
[]
optimizeCurvature
(
QuinticHermiteSpline
[] splines)
Optimizes the curvature of 2 or more quintic splines at knot points. Overall, this reduces the
 integral of the absolute value of the second derivative across the set of splines.
Parameters:
splines
- An array of un-optimized quintic splines.
Returns:
An array of optimized quintic splines.
