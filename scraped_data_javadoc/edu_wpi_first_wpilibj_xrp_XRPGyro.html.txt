public class
XRPGyro
extends
Object
Use a rate gyro to return the robots heading relative to a starting position.
This class is for the XRP onboard gyro, and will only work in simulation/XRP mode. Only one
 instance of a XRPGyro is supported.

getRateX
public
double
getRateX
()
Get the rate of turn in degrees-per-second around the X-axis.
Returns:
rate of turn in degrees-per-second
getRateY
public
double
getRateY
()
Get the rate of turn in degrees-per-second around the Y-axis.
Returns:

getRateZ
public
double
getRateZ
()

getAngleY
public
double
getAngleY
()
Get the currently reported angle around the X-axis.
Returns:
current angle around Y-axis in degrees
getAngleZ
public
double
getAngleZ
()
Get the currently reported angle around the Z-axis.
Returns:

reset
public
void
reset
()
Reset the gyro angles to 0.
getAngle
public
double
getAngle
()
Return the actual angle in degrees that the robot is currently facing.
The angle is based on integration of the returned rate form the gyro. The angle is
 continuous, that is, it will continue from 360->361 degrees. This allows algorithms that
 wouldn't want to see a discontinuity in the gyro output as it sweeps from 360 to 0 on the
 second time around.
Returns:
the current heading of the robot in degrees.
getRotation2d
public
Rotation2d
getRotation2d
()
Gets the angle the robot is facing.
Returns:
A Rotation2d with the current heading.
getRate
public
double
getRate
()
Return the rate of rotation of the gyro
The rate is based on the most recent reading of the gyro.
Returns:
the current rate in degrees per second
