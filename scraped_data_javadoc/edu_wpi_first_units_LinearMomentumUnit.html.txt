Method Details
combine
public static
LinearMomentumUnit
combine
(
MassUnit
mass,
LinearVelocityUnit
velocity)
Combines a mass and linear velocity unit to form a combined linear momentum unit.
Parameters:
mass
- the unit of mass
velocity
- the unit of velocity
Returns:
the combined unit of momentum
getBaseUnit
public
LinearMomentumUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:

Returns:
the base unit
of
public
LinearMomentum
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
MultUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
MultUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
Mult
instance. If you want to
 avoid casting, use
MultUnit.ofNativeBaseUnits(double)
that returns a
Per
instance
 directly.
Overrides:
of
in class
MultUnit
<
MassUnit
,
LinearVelocityUnit
>
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measure in terms of its base units.
Returns:
the measurement object
ofBaseUnits
public
LinearMomentum
ofBaseUnits
(double baseUnitMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
MultUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
MultUnit
(and
not

 avoid casting, use
MultUnit.ofNativeBaseUnits(double)
that returns a

Parameters:
baseUnitMagnitude
- the magnitude of the measure in terms of its base units.
Returns:
the measurement object
zero
public
LinearMomentum
zero
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override this
 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:

Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure with a magnitude of 1.0 in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed
 to be of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override
 this method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:

(double initialMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
