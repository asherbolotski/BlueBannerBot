public final class
DistanceUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of linear dimension.
This is the base type for units of linear dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for
Measure
:
Measure<DistanceUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Meters
and
Units.Inches
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
DistanceUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit
in class
Unit
Returns:
the base unit
per
public
LinearVelocityUnit
per
(
TimeUnit
period)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Combines this unit with a unit of time. This often - but not always - results in a velocity.
 Subclasses should sharpen the return type to be unit-specific.
Specified by:
per
in class
Unit
Parameters:
period
- the unit of time
Returns:
the combined unit
per

per
(U other)
Creates a ratio unit between this unit and an arbitrary other unit.
Type Parameters:
U
- the type of the other unit
Parameters:
other
- the other unit
Returns:
the ratio unit
convertFrom
public
double
convertFrom
(double magnitude,
DistanceUnit
otherUnit)
Converts a measurement value in terms of another distance unit to this unit.
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement in terms of the other distance unit
otherUnit
- the other distance unit
Returns:
the value of the measurement in terms of this unit
of

Distance
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement.
Returns:
the measurement object
ofBaseUnits

()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
