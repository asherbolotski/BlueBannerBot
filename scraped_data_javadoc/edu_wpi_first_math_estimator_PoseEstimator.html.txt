PoseEstimator
<T>

Object
This class wraps
Odometry
to fuse latency-compensated vision measurements with encoder
 measurements. Robot code should not use this directly- Instead, use the particular type for your
 drivetrain (e.g.,
DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator
). It is intended to be a drop-in
 replacement for
Odometry
; in fact, if you never call
addVisionMeasurement(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Pose2d, double)
and only call
update(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Rotation2d, T)
then this will
 behave exactly the same as Odometry.
update(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Rotation2d, T)
should be called every robot loop.
addVisionMeasurement(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Pose2d, double)
can be called as infrequently as you want; if you
 never call it then this class will behave exactly like regular encoder odometry.

Constructs a PoseEstimator.
Parameters:
kinematics
- A correctly-configured kinematics object for your drivetrain.
odometry
- A correctly-configured odometry object for your drivetrain.
stateStdDevs
- Standard deviations of the pose estimate (x position in meters, y position
     in meters, and heading in radians). Increase these numbers to trust your state estimate
     less.
visionMeasurementStdDevs
- Standard deviations of the vision pose measurement (x position
     in meters, y position in meters, and heading in radians). Increase these numbers to trust
     the vision pose measurement less.
Method Details
setVisionMeasurementStdDevs
public final
void
setVisionMeasurementStdDevs
(
Matrix
<
N3
,
N1
> visionMeasurementStdDevs)
Sets the pose estimator's trust of global measurements. This might be used to change trust in
 vision measurements after the autonomous period, or to change trust as distance to a vision
 target increases.
Parameters:
visionMeasurementStdDevs
- Standard deviations of the vision measurements. Increase these
     numbers to trust global measurements from vision less. This matrix is in the form [x, y,
     theta]ᵀ, with units in meters and radians.
resetPosition
public
void
resetPosition
(
Rotation2d
gyroAngle,
T
wheelPositions,
Pose2d
poseMeters)
Resets the robot's position on the field.
The gyroscope angle does not need to be reset here on the user's robot code. The library
 automatically takes care of offsetting the gyro angle.
Parameters:
gyroAngle
- The angle reported by the gyroscope.
wheelPositions
- The current encoder readings.
poseMeters
- The position on the field that your robot is at.
resetPose
public
void
resetPose
(
Pose2d
pose)
Resets the robot's pose.
Parameters:
pose
- The pose to reset to.
resetTranslation
public
void
resetTranslation
(
Translation2d
translation)
Resets the robot's translation.
Parameters:
translation
- The pose to translation to.
resetRotation
public
void
resetRotation
(
Rotation2d
rotation)
Resets the robot's rotation.
Parameters:
rotation
- The rotation to reset to.
getEstimatedPosition
public
Pose2d
getEstimatedPosition
()
Gets the estimated robot pose.
Returns:
The estimated robot pose in meters.
sampleAt
public
Optional
<
Pose2d
>
sampleAt
(double timestampSeconds)
Return the pose at a given timestamp, if the buffer is not empty.
Parameters:
timestampSeconds
- The pose's timestamp in seconds.
Returns:
The pose at the given timestamp (or Optional.empty() if the buffer is empty).
addVisionMeasurement
public
void
addVisionMeasurement
(
Pose2d
visionRobotPoseMeters,
 double timestampSeconds)
Adds a vision measurement to the Kalman Filter. This will correct the odometry pose estimate
 while still accounting for measurement noise.
This method can be called as infrequently as you want, as long as you are calling
update(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Rotation2d, T)
every loop.
To promote stability of the pose estimate and make it robust to bad vision data, we
 recommend only adding vision measurements that are already within one meter or so of the
 current pose estimate.
Parameters:
visionRobotPoseMeters
- The pose of the robot as measured by the vision camera.
timestampSeconds
- The timestamp of the vision measurement in seconds. Note that if you
     don't use your own time source by calling
updateWithTime(double,Rotation2d,Object)
then you must use a timestamp with
     an epoch since FPGA startup (i.e., the epoch of this timestamp is the same epoch as
Timer.getFPGATimestamp()
.) This means that you should use
Timer.getFPGATimestamp()
as your time source or sync the epochs.
addVisionMeasurement
public
void
addVisionMeasurement
(
Pose2d
visionRobotPoseMeters,
 double timestampSeconds,
Matrix
<
N3
,
N1
> visionMeasurementStdDevs)
Adds a vision measurement to the Kalman Filter. This will correct the odometry pose estimate
 while still accounting for measurement noise.
This method can be called as infrequently as you want, as long as you are calling
update(edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Rotation2d, T)
every loop.
To promote stability of the pose estimate and make it robust to bad vision data, we
 recommend only adding vision measurements that are already within one meter or so of the
 current pose estimate.
Note that the vision measurement standard deviations passed into this method will continue
 to apply to future measurements until a subsequent call to
setVisionMeasurementStdDevs(Matrix)
or this method.
Parameters:
visionRobotPoseMeters
- The pose of the robot as measured by the vision camera.
timestampSeconds
- The timestamp of the vision measurement in seconds. Note that if you
     don't use your own time source by calling
updateWithTime(double, edu.wpi.first.math.geometry.Rotation2d, T)
, then you must use a
     timestamp with an epoch since FPGA startup (i.e., the epoch of this timestamp is the same
     epoch as
Timer.getFPGATimestamp()
). This means that you
     should use
Timer.getFPGATimestamp()
as your time source in
     this case.
visionMeasurementStdDevs
- Standard deviations of the vision pose measurement (x position
     in meters, y position in meters, and heading in radians). Increase these numbers to trust
     the vision pose measurement less.
