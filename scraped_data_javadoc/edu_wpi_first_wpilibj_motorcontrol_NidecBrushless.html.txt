Constructor Details
NidecBrushless
public
NidecBrushless
(int pwmChannel,
 int dioChannel)
Constructor.
Parameters:
pwmChannel
- The PWM channel that the Nidec Brushless controller is attached to. 0-9 are
     on-board, 10-19 are on the MXP port
dioChannel
- The DIO channel that the Nidec Brushless controller is attached to. 0-9 are
     on-board, 10-25 are on the MXP port
Method Details
close
public
void
close
()
Specified by:
close
in interface
AutoCloseable
set
public
void
set
(double speed)
Set the PWM value.
The PWM value is set using a range of -1.0 to 1.0, appropriately scaling the value for the
 FPGA.
Specified by:
set
in interface
MotorController
Parameters:
speed
- The speed value between -1.0 and 1.0 to set.
get
public
double
get
()
Get the recently set value of the PWM.
Specified by:
get
in interface
MotorController
Returns:
The most recently set value for the PWM between -1.0 and 1.0.
setInverted
public
void
setInverted
(boolean isInverted)
Description copied from interface:
MotorController
Common interface for inverting direction of a motor controller.
Specified by:
setInverted
in interface
MotorController
Parameters:
isInverted
- The state of inversion true is inverted.
getInverted
public
boolean
getInverted
()
Description copied from interface:
MotorController
Common interface for returning if a motor controller is in the inverted state or not.
Specified by:
getInverted
in interface
MotorController
Returns:
isInverted The state of the inversion true is inverted.
stopMotor
public
void
stopMotor
()
Stop the motor. This is called by the MotorSafety object when it has a timeout for this PWM and
 needs to stop it from running. Calling set() will re-enable the motor.
Specified by:
stopMotor
in interface
MotorController
Specified by:
stopMotor
in class
MotorSafety
getDescription
public
String
getDescription
()
Description copied from class:
MotorSafety
Returns a description to print when an error occurs.
Specified by:
getDescription
in class
MotorSafety
Returns:
Description to print when an error occurs.
disable
public
void
disable
()
Disable the motor. The enable() function must be called to re-enable the motor.
Specified by:
disable
in interface
MotorController
enable
public
void
enable
()
Re-enable the motor after disable() has been called. The set() function must be called to set a
 new motor speed.
getChannel
public
int
getChannel
()
Gets the channel number associated with the object.
Returns:
The channel number.
initSendable
public
void
initSendable
(
SendableBuilder
builder)
Description copied from interface:
Sendable
Initializes this
Sendable
object.
Specified by:
initSendable
in interface
Sendable
Parameters:
builder
- sendable builder
