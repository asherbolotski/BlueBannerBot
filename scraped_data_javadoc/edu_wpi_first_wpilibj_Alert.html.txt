Alert
extends
Object
implements
AutoCloseable
Persistent alert to be sent via NetworkTables. Alerts are tagged with a type of
kError
,
kWarning
, or
kInfo
to denote urgency. See
AlertType
for suggested usage of each type. Alerts can be
 displayed on supported dashboards, and are shown in a priority order based on type and recency of
 activation, with newly activated alerts first.
Alerts should be created once and stored persistently, then updated to "active" or "inactive"
 as necessary.
set(boolean)
can be safely called periodically.
This API is new for 2025, but is likely to change in future seasons to facilitate deeper
 integration with the robot control system.
class Robot {
   Alert alert = new Alert("Something went wrong", AlertType.kWarning);

   periodic() {
     alert.set(...);
   }
 }
Alternatively, alerts which are only used once at startup can be created and activated inline.
public Robot() {
   new Alert("Failed to load auto paths", AlertType.kError).set(true);
 }
