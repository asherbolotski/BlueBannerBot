edu.wpi.first.units.MassUnit
public final class
MassUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of mass dimension.
This is the base type for units of mass dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for the mass-specific
Mass
measurement type.
Actual units (such as
Units.Grams
and
Units.Pounds
) can be found in the
Units
class.

getBaseUnit
public
MassUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit
in class
Unit
Returns:
the base unit
of
public
Mass
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

in class
Unit
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement.
Returns:
the measurement object
ofBaseUnits
public
Mass
ofBaseUnits
(double baseUnitMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:
ofBaseUnits
in class
Unit
Parameters:
baseUnitMagnitude
- the magnitude in terms of the base unit
Returns:
the measurement object

public
Mass
zero
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override this
 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:
zero
in class
Unit
Returns:
a zero-magnitude measure of this unit
one
public

()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure with a magnitude of 1.0 in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed
 to be of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override
 this method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:

Returns:
a measure of magnitude 1.0 in terms of this unit
mutable
public
MutMass
mutable
(double initialMagnitude)
Description copied from class:

Creates a new mutable measurement that is initialized to the given magnitude in terms of this
 unit. Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:
