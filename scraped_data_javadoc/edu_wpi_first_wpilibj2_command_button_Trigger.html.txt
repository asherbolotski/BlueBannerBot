implements
BooleanSupplier
This class provides an easy way to link commands to conditions.
It is very easy to link a button to a command. For instance, you could link the trigger button
 of a joystick to a "score" command.
Triggers can easily be composed for advanced functionality using the
and(BooleanSupplier)
,
or(BooleanSupplier)
,
negate()
operators.

Parameters:
loop
- The loop instance that polls this trigger.
condition
- the condition represented by this trigger
Trigger
public
Trigger
(
BooleanSupplier
condition)
Creates a new trigger based on the given condition.
Polled by the default scheduler button loop.
Parameters:
condition
- the condition represented by this trigger
Method Details
onChange
public
Trigger
onChange
(
Command
command)
Starts the command when the condition changes.
Parameters:
command
- the command to start
Returns:
this trigger, so calls can be chained
