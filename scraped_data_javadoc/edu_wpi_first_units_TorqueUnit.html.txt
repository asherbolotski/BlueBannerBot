Method Details
combine
public static
TorqueUnit
combine
(
DistanceUnit
distance,
ForceUnit
force)
Combines a unit of distance and force to create a unit of torque.
Parameters:
distance
- the distance unit
force
- the force unit
Returns:
the combined torque unit
getBaseUnit
public
TorqueUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:

Returns:

of
public
Torque
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
MultUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
MultUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
Mult
instance. If you want to
 avoid casting, use
MultUnit.ofNativeBaseUnits(double)
that returns a
Per
instance
 directly.
Overrides:
of
in class
MultUnit
<
DistanceUnit
,
ForceUnit
>
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measure in terms of its base units.
Returns:
the measurement object
ofBaseUnits
public

ofBaseUnits
(double baseUnitMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
MultUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
MultUnit
(and

Parameters:
baseUnitMagnitude
- the magnitude of the measure in terms of its base units.
Returns:
the measurement object
zero
public
Torque
zero
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override this
 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:
zero
in class

Returns:
a zero-magnitude measure of this unit

Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure with a magnitude of 1.0 in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed
 to be of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override
 this method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:

mutable
(double initialMagnitude)
Description copied from class:

Creates a new mutable measurement that is initialized to the given magnitude in terms of this
 unit. Implementations are

recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Overrides:

per
(
TimeUnit
time)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Combines this unit with a unit of time. This often - but not always - results in a velocity.
 Subclasses should sharpen the return type to be unit-specific.
Overrides:
