edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.Tracer
public class
Tracer
extends
Object
A class for keeping track of how much time it takes for different parts of code to execute. This
 is done with epochs, that are added by calls to
addEpoch(String)
, and can be printed
 with a call to
printEpochs()
.
Epochs are a way to partition the time elapsed so that when overruns occur, one can determine
 which parts of an operation consumed the most time.

Method Details
clearEpochs
public
void
clearEpochs
()
Clears all epochs.
resetTimer
public final
void
resetTimer
()
Restarts the epoch timer.
addEpoch
public
void
addEpoch
(
String
epochName)
Adds time since last epoch to the list printed by printEpochs().
Epochs are a way to partition the time elapsed so that when overruns occur, one can
 determine which parts of an operation consumed the most time.
This should be called immediately after execution has finished, with a call to this method
 or
resetTimer()
before execution.
Parameters:
epochName
- The name to associate with the epoch.
printEpochs
public
void
printEpochs
()
Prints list of epochs added so far and their times to the DriverStation.
printEpochs
public
void
printEpochs
(
Consumer
<
String
> output)
Prints list of epochs added so far and their times to the entered String consumer.
This overload can be useful for logging to a file, etc.
Parameters:
output
- the stream that the output is sent to
