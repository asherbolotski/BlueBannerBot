Deprecated Constructors
Constructor
Description
edu.wpi.first.math.controller.RamseteController()
Use LTVUnicycleController instead.
edu.wpi.first.math.controller.RamseteController
(double, double)
Use LTVUnicycleController instead.
edu.wpi.first.math.trajectory.constraint.EllipticalRegionConstraint
(Translation2d, double, double, Rotation2d, TrajectoryConstraint)
Use constructor taking Ellipse2d instead.
edu.wpi.first.math.trajectory.constraint.RectangularRegionConstraint
(Translation2d, Translation2d, TrajectoryConstraint)
Use constructor taking Rectangle2d instead.
edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.MecanumControllerCommand
(Trajectory, Supplier<Pose2d>, SimpleMotorFeedforward, MecanumDriveKinematics, PIDController, PIDController, ProfiledPIDController, double, PIDController, PIDController, PIDController, PIDController, Supplier<MecanumDriveWheelSpeeds>, Consumer<MecanumDriveMotorVoltages>, Subsystem...)
edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.MecanumControllerCommand
(Trajectory, Supplier<Pose2d>, SimpleMotorFeedforward, MecanumDriveKinematics, PIDController, PIDController, ProfiledPIDController, Supplier<Rotation2d>, double, PIDController, PIDController, PIDController, PIDController, Supplier<MecanumDriveWheelSpeeds>, Consumer<MecanumDriveMotorVoltages>, Subsystem...)
edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.ProxyCommand
(Supplier<Command>)
This constructor's similarity to
DeferredCommand
is confusing and opens
     potential footguns for users who do not fully understand the semantics and implications of
     proxying, but who simply want runtime construction. Users who do know what they are doing
     and need a supplier-constructed proxied command should instead defer a proxy command.
edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.RamseteCommand
(Trajectory, Supplier<Pose2d>, RamseteController, SimpleMotorFeedforward, DifferentialDriveKinematics, Supplier<DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds>, PIDController, PIDController, BiConsumer<Double, Double>, Subsystem...)
Use LTVUnicycleController instead.
edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.RamseteCommand
(Trajectory, Supplier<Pose2d>, RamseteController, DifferentialDriveKinematics, BiConsumer<Double, Double>, Subsystem...)
Use LTVUnicycleController instead.
