Method Details
combine
public static
AngularVelocityUnit
combine
(
AngleUnit
angle,
TimeUnit
time)
Combines an angle unit and a period of time into a unit of angular velocity.
Parameters:
angle
- the unit of the changing angle
time
- the period of the changing angle
Returns:
the combined angular velocity unit
getBaseUnit
public
AngularVelocityUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit

public
AngularVelocity
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
PerUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
PerUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
Per
instance. If you want to
 avoid casting, use
PerUnit.ofNative(double)
that returns a
Per
instance directly.
Overrides:
of
in class
PerUnit
<
AngleUnit
,
TimeUnit

Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measure
Returns:
the ratio measure
ofBaseUnits
public
AngularVelocity
ofBaseUnits
(double baseUnitMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
PerUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
PerUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
Per
instance. If you want to
 avoid casting, use
PerUnit.ofNativeBaseUnits(double)
that returns a
Per
instance
 directly.
Overrides:
ofBaseUnits
in class
PerUnit
<
AngleUnit

Parameters:
baseUnitMagnitude
- the magnitude of the measure in terms of its base units.
Returns:
the ratio measure
zero
public
AngularVelocity
zero
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override this
 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:
zero
in class
PerUnit
<
AngleUnit

Returns:
a zero-magnitude measure of this unit
one
public
AngularVelocity
one
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure with a magnitude of 1.0 in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed
 to be of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override
 this method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:
one
in class
PerUnit
<
AngleUnit

Returns:
a measure of magnitude 1.0 in terms of this unit
mutable
public
MutAngularVelocity
mutable
(double initialMagnitude)
Description copied from class:
PerUnit
Creates a new mutable measurement that is initialized to the given magnitude in terms of this
 unit. Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
PerUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
MutPer
instance.
Overrides:

Parameters:
initialMagnitude
- the starting magnitude of the measure
Returns:
the ratio measure
per
public
AngularAccelerationUnit
per

TimeUnit
period)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Combines this unit with a unit of time. This often - but not always - results in a velocity.
 Subclasses should sharpen the return type to be unit-specific.
Overrides:
per
in class
PerUnit

- the unit of time
Returns:

per
(U other)
Creates a ratio unit between this unit and an arbitrary other unit.
Type Parameters:

convertFrom
public
double
convertFrom
(double magnitude,
AngularVelocityUnit
otherUnit)
Converts a measurement value in terms of another unit to this unit.
Parameters:

Returns:
the value of the measurement in terms of this unit
