Command
A composition that runs a set of commands in parallel, ending when any one of the commands ends
 and interrupting all the others.
The rules for command compositions apply: command instances that are passed to it cannot be
 added to any other composition or scheduled individually, and the composition requires all
 subsystems its components require.
