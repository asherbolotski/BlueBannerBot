Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Use a TrapezoidProfile instead
A subsystem that generates and runs trapezoidal motion profiles automatically. The user specifies
 how to use the current state of the motion profile by overriding the `useState` method.

TrapezoidProfileSubsystem
public
TrapezoidProfileSubsystem
(
TrapezoidProfile.Constraints

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Creates a new TrapezoidProfileSubsystem.
Parameters:
constraints
- The constraints (maximum velocity and acceleration) for the profiles.
initialPosition
- The initial position of the controlled mechanism when the subsystem is
     constructed.
period
- The period of the main robot loop, in seconds.

void
periodic
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Description copied from interface:
Subsystem
This method is called periodically by the
CommandScheduler
. Useful for updating
 subsystem-specific state that you don't want to offload to a
Command
. Teams should try
 to be consistent within their own codebases about which responsibilities will be handled by
 Commands, and which will be handled here.
setGoal
public final
void
setGoal
(
TrapezoidProfile.State
goal)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the goal state for the subsystem.
Parameters:
goal
- The goal state for the subsystem's motion profile.
setGoal
public final
void
setGoal
(double goal)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the goal state for the subsystem. Goal velocity assumed to be zero.
Parameters:
goal
- The goal position for the subsystem's motion profile.
enable
public
void
enable

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Enable the TrapezoidProfileSubsystem's output.
disable
public
void
disable
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Disable the TrapezoidProfileSubsystem's output.
useState
protected abstract
void
useState
(
TrapezoidProfile.State
state)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Users should override this to consume the current state of the motion profile.
Parameters:
state
- The current state of the motion profile.
