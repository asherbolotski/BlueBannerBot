Method
Description
default void
forEach
(
LEDReader.IndexedColorIterator
iterator)
Iterates over the LEDs in the buffer, starting from index 0.
int
getBlue
(int index)
Gets the blue channel of the color at the specified index.
int
getGreen
(int index)
Gets the green channel of the color at the specified index.
default
Color
getLED
(int index)
Gets the most recently written color for a particular LED in the buffer.
default
Color8Bit
getLED8Bit
(int index)
Gets the most recently written color for a particular LED in the buffer.
int
getLength
()
Gets the length of the buffer.
int
getRed
(int index)
Gets the red channel of the color at the specified index.
Method Details
getLength
int
getLength
()
Gets the length of the buffer.
Returns:
the buffer length
getLED
default
Color
getLED
(int index)
Gets the most recently written color for a particular LED in the buffer.
Parameters:
index
- the index of the LED
Returns:
the LED color
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the index is negative or greater than
getLength()
getLED8Bit
default
Color8Bit
getLED8Bit
(int index)
Gets the most recently written color for a particular LED in the buffer.
Parameters:
index
- the index of the LED
Returns:
the LED color
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException
- if the index is negative or greater than
getLength()
getRed
int
getRed
(int index)
Gets the red channel of the color at the specified index.
Parameters:
index
- the index of the LED to read
Returns:
the value of the red channel, from [0, 255]
getGreen
int
getGreen
(int index)
Gets the green channel of the color at the specified index.
Parameters:
index
- the index of the LED to read
Returns:
the value of the green channel, from [0, 255]
getBlue
int
getBlue
(int index)
Gets the blue channel of the color at the specified index.
Parameters:
index
- the index of the LED to read
Returns:
the value of the blue channel, from [0, 255]
forEach
default
void
forEach
(
LEDReader.IndexedColorIterator
iterator)
Iterates over the LEDs in the buffer, starting from index 0. The iterator function is passed
 the current index of iteration, along with the values for the red, green, and blue components
 of the color written to the LED at that index.
Parameters:
iterator
- the iterator function to call for each LED in the buffer.
