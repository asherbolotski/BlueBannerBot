Standard hobby style servo.
The range parameters default to the appropriate values for the Hitec HS-322HD servo provided
 in the FIRST Kit of Parts in 2008.

Constructor Details
Servo
public
Servo
(int channel)
Constructor.
By default, 2400 ms is used as the max PWM value and 600 ms is used as the minPWM value.
Parameters:
channel
- The PWM channel to which the servo is attached. 0-9 are on-board, 10-19 are on
     the MXP port
Method Details
set
public
void
set
(double value)
Set the servo position.
Servo values range from 0.0 to 1.0 corresponding to the range of full left to full right.
Parameters:
value
- Position from 0.0 to 1.0.
get
public
double
get
()
Get the servo position.
Servo values range from 0.0 to 1.0 corresponding to the range of full left to full right.
 This returns the commanded position, not the position that the servo is actually at, as the
 servo does not report its own position.
Returns:
Position from 0.0 to 1.0.
setAngle
public
void
setAngle
(double degrees)
Set the servo angle.
The angles are based on the HS-322HD Servo, and have a range of 0 to 180 degrees.
Servo angles that are out of the supported range of the servo simply "saturate" in that
 direction In other words, if the servo has a range of (X degrees to Y degrees) than angles of
 less than X result in an angle of X being set and angles of more than Y degrees result in an
 angle of Y being set.
Parameters:
degrees
- The angle in degrees to set the servo.
getAngle
public
double
getAngle
()
Get the servo angle.
This returns the commanded angle, not the angle that the servo is actually at, as the servo
 does not report its own angle.
Returns:
The angle in degrees to which the servo is set.
