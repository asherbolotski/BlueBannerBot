Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Will be removed with no replacement.
Track resources in the program. The Resource class is a convenient way of keeping track of
 allocated arbitrary resources in the program. Resources are just indices that have a lower and
 upper bound that are tracked by this class. In the library they are used for tracking allocation
 of hardware channels but this is purely arbitrary. The resource class does not do any actual
 allocation, but simply tracks if a given index is currently in use.
WARNING:
this should only be statically allocated. When the program loads into memory
 all the static constructors are called. At that time a linked list of all the "Resources" is
 created. Then, when the program actually starts - in the Robot constructor, all resources are
 initialized. This ensures that the program is restartable in memory without having to
 unload/reload.

Resource
(int size)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Allocate storage for a new instance of Resource. Allocate a bool array of values that will get
 initialized to indicate that no resources have been allocated yet. The indices of the resources
 are 0..size-1.
Parameters:
size
- The number of blocks to allocate

CheckedAllocationException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Allocate a resource. When a resource is requested, mark it allocated. In this case, a free
 resource value within the range is located and returned after it is marked allocated.
Returns:
The index of the allocated block.
Throws:
CheckedAllocationException
- If there are no resources available to be allocated.

CheckedAllocationException
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Allocate a specific resource value. The user requests a specific resource value, i.e. channel
 number, and it is verified unallocated, then returned.
Parameters:
index
- The resource to allocate
Returns:
The index of the allocated block
Throws:
CheckedAllocationException
- If there are no resources available to be allocated.
free

free
(int index)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Free an allocated resource. After a resource is no longer needed, for example a destructor is
 called for a channel assignment class, this method will release the resource value, so it can
 be reused somewhere else in the program.
Parameters:
index
- The index of the resource to free.
