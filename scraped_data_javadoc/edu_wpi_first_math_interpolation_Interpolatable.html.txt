Interpolatable
<T>
An object should extend interpolatable if you wish to interpolate between a lower and upper
 bound, such as a robot position on the field between timesteps. This behavior can be linear or
 nonlinear.

interpolate
T
interpolate
(
T
endValue,
 double t)
Return the interpolated value. This object is assumed to be the starting position, or lower
 bound.
Parameters:
endValue
- The upper bound, or end.
t
- How far between the lower and upper bound we are. This should be bounded in [0, 1].
Returns:
The interpolated value.
