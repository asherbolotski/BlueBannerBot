Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Description copied from interface:
MotorController
Common interface for setting the speed of a motor controller.
Specified by:
set
in interface
MotorController
Parameters:
speed
- The speed to set. Value should be between -1.0 and 1.0.
setVoltage
public
void
setVoltage
(double outputVolts)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Description copied from interface:
MotorController
Sets the voltage output of the MotorController. Compensates for the current bus voltage to
 ensure that the desired voltage is output even if the battery voltage is below 12V - highly
 useful when the voltage outputs are "meaningful" (e.g. they come from a feedforward
 calculation).
NOTE: This function *must* be called regularly in order for voltage compensation to work
 properly - unlike the ordinary set function, it is not "set it and forget it."
Specified by:
setVoltage
in interface
MotorController
Parameters:
outputVolts
- The voltage to output, in Volts.
