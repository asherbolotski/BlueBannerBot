Method Details
copyPipelineOutputs
void
copyPipelineOutputs
(
P
pipeline)
Called when the pipeline has run. This shouldn't take much time to run because it will delay
 later calls to the pipeline's
process
method. Copying the
 outputs and code that uses the copies should be

Parameters:
pipeline
- the vision pipeline that ran
