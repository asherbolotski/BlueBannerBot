UnitBuilder
<U>
derive
(U unit)
Creates a new unit builder object based on a given input unit. The builder can be used to
 fluently describe a new unit in terms of its relation to the base unit.
Type Parameters:
U
- the dimension of the unit to derive
Parameters:
unit
- the base unit from which to derive a new unit
Returns:
a builder object
