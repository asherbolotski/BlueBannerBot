Method Details
objectToRobotPose
public static
Pose3d
objectToRobotPose
(
Pose3d
objectInField,
Transform3d
cameraToObject,
Transform3d
robotToCamera)
Returns the robot's pose in the field coordinate system given an object's field-relative pose,
 the transformation from the camera's pose to the object's pose (obtained via computer vision),
 and the transformation from the robot's pose to the camera's pose.
The object could be a target or a fiducial marker.
Parameters:
objectInField
- An object's field-relative pose.
cameraToObject
- The transformation from the camera's pose to the object's pose. This
     comes from computer vision.
robotToCamera
- The transformation from the robot's pose to the camera's pose. This can
     either be a constant for a rigidly mounted camera, or variable if the camera is mounted to
     a turret. If the camera was mounted 3 inches in front of the "origin" (usually physical
     center) of the robot, this would be new Transform3d(Units.inchesToMeters(3.0), 0.0, 0.0,
     Rotation3d.kZero).
Returns:
The robot's field-relative pose.
