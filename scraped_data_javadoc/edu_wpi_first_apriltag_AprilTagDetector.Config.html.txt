Field Details
numThreads
public
int
numThreads
How many threads should be used for computation. Default is single-threaded operation (1
 thread).
quadDecimate
public
float
quadDecimate
Quad decimation. Detection of quads can be done on a lower-resolution image, improving speed
 at a cost of pose accuracy and a slight decrease in detection rate. Decoding the binary
 payload is still done at full resolution. Default is 2.0.
quadSigma
public
float
quadSigma
What Gaussian blur should be applied to the segmented image (used for quad detection). Very
 noisy images benefit from non-zero values (e.g. 0.8). Default is 0.0.
refineEdges
public
boolean
refineEdges
When true, the edges of the each quad are adjusted to "snap to" strong gradients nearby. This
 is useful when decimation is employed, as it can increase the quality of the initial quad
 estimate substantially. Generally recommended to be on (true). Default is true.
Very computationally inexpensive. Option is ignored if quad_decimate = 1.
decodeSharpening
public
double
decodeSharpening
How much sharpening should be done to decoded images. This can help decode small tags but may
 or may not help in odd lighting conditions or low light conditions. Default is 0.25.
debug
public
boolean
debug
Debug mode. When true, the decoder writes a variety of debugging images to the current
 working directory at various stages through the detection process. This is slow and should
 *not* be used on space-limited systems such as the RoboRIO. Default is disabled (false).
