SharpIR analog distance sensor class. These distance measuring sensors output an analog voltage
 corresponding to the detection distance.
Teams are advised that the case of these sensors are conductive and grounded, so they should
 not be mounted on a metallic surface on an FRC robot.

SharpIR
(int channel,
 double a,
 double b,
 double minCM,
 double maxCM)
Manually construct a SharpIR object. The distance is computed using this formula: A*v ^ B.
 Prefer to use one of the static factories to create this device instead.
Parameters:
channel
- AnalogInput channel
a
- Constant A
b
- Constant B
minCM
- Minimum distance to report in centimeters
maxCM
- Maximum distance to report in centimeters
