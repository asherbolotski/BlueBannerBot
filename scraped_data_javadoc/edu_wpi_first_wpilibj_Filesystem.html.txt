public final class
Filesystem
extends
Object
Class for interacting with the Filesystem, particularly, interacting with FRC-related paths on
 the system, such as the launch and deploy directories.
This class is primarily used for obtaining resources in src/main/deploy, and the RoboRIO path
 /home/lvuser in a simulation-compatible way.

Method Details
getLaunchDirectory
public static
File
getLaunchDirectory
()
Obtains the current working path that the program was launched with. This is analogous to the
 `pwd` command on unix.
Returns:
The current working directory (launch directory)
getOperatingDirectory
public static
File
getOperatingDirectory
()
Obtains the operating directory of the program. On the roboRIO, this is /home/lvuser. In
 simulation, it is where the simulation was launched from (`pwd`).
Returns:
The operating directory
getDeployDirectory
public static
File
getDeployDirectory
()
Obtains the 'deploy' directory of the program, located at src/main/deploy, which is deployed by
 default. On the roboRIO, this is /home/lvuser/deploy. In simulation, it is where the simulation
 was launched from, in the subdirectory "src/main/deploy" (`pwd`/src/main/deploy).
Returns:
The 'deploy' directory
