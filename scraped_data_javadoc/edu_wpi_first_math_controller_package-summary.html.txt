Description
ArmFeedforward
A helper class that computes feedforward outputs for a simple arm (modeled as a motor acting
 against the force of gravity on a beam suspended at an angle).
BangBangController
Implements a bang-bang controller, which outputs either 0 or 1 depending on whether the
 measurement is less than the setpoint.

DifferentialDriveAccelerationLimiter
Filters the provided voltages to limit a differential drive's linear and angular acceleration.
DifferentialDriveFeedforward
A helper class which computes the feedforward outputs for a differential drive drivetrain.
DifferentialDriveWheelVoltages
Motor voltages for a differential drive.
ElevatorFeedforward
A helper class that computes feedforward outputs for a simple elevator (modeled as a motor acting
 against the force of gravity).

LTVDifferentialDriveController
The linear time-varying differential drive controller has a similar form to the LQR, but the
 model used to compute the controller gain is the nonlinear differential drive model linearized
 around the drivetrain's current state.
LTVUnicycleController
The linear time-varying unicycle controller has a similar form to the LQR, but the model used to
 compute the controller gain is the nonlinear unicycle model linearized around the drivetrain's
 current state.
PIDController
Implements a PID control loop.
ProfiledPIDController
Implements a PID control loop whose setpoint is constrained by a trapezoid profile.
RamseteController
Ramsete is a nonlinear time-varying feedback controller for unicycle models that drives the model
 to a desired pose along a two-dimensional trajectory.
SimpleMotorFeedforward
A helper class that computes feedforward outputs for a simple permanent-magnet DC motor.
