GenericHID
Handle input from Flight Joysticks connected to the Driver Station.
This class handles standard input that comes from the Driver Station. Each time a value is
 requested the most recent value is returned. There is a single class instance for each joystick
 and the mapping of ports to hardware buttons depends on the code in the Driver Station.
