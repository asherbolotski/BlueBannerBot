CounterBase
Interface for counting the number of ticks on a digital input channel. Encoders, Gear tooth
 sensors, and counters should all subclass this in order to build more advanced classes for
 control and driving.
All counters will immediately start counting - reset() them if you need them to be zeroed
 before use.
