public final class
VoltageUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of electric voltage dimension.
This is the base type for units of voltage dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for
Measure
:
Measure<VoltageUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Volts
and
Units.Millivolts
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
VoltageUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit

Unit
Returns:
the base unit
mult
public
PowerUnit
mult
(
CurrentUnit
current,
String
name,
String
symbol)
Constructs a unit of power equivalent to this unit of voltage multiplied by another unit of
 electrical current. For example,
Volts.times(Amps)
will return a unit of power
 equivalent to one Watt;
Volts.times(Milliamps)
will return a unit of power equivalent
 to a milliwatt, and so on.
Parameters:
current
- the current unit to multiply by
name
- the name of the resulting unit of power
symbol
- the symbol used to represent the unit of power
Returns:
the power unit
of
