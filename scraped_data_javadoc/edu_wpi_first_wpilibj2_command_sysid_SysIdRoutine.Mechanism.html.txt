Create a new mechanism specification for a SysId routine.
Parameters:
drive
- Sends the SysId-specified drive signal to the mechanism motors during test
     routines.
log
- Returns measured data of the mechanism motors during test routines. To return
     data, call `motor(string motorName)` on the supplied `SysIdRoutineLog` instance, and then
     call one or more of the chainable logging handles (e.g. `voltage`) on the returned
     `MotorLog`. Multiple motors can be logged in a single callback by calling `motor`
     multiple times.
subsystem
- The subsystem containing the motor(s) that is (or are) being characterized.
     Will be declared as a requirement for the returned test commands.
name
- The name of the mechanism being tested. Will be appended to the log entry title
     for the routine's test state, e.g. "sysid-test-state-mechanism". Defaults to the name of
     the subsystem if left null.

subsystem)
Create a new mechanism specification for a SysId routine. Defaults the mechanism name to the
 subsystem name.
Parameters:
drive
- Sends the SysId-specified drive signal to the mechanism motors during test
     routines.
log
- Returns measured data of the mechanism motors during test routines. To return
     data, call `motor(string motorName)` on the supplied `SysIdRoutineLog` instance, and then
     call one or more of the chainable logging handles (e.g. `voltage`) on the returned
     `MotorLog`. Multiple motors can be logged in a single callback by calling `motor`
     multiple times.
subsystem
- The subsystem containing the motor(s) that is (or are) being characterized.
     Will be declared as a requirement for the returned test commands. The subsystem's `name`
     will be appended to the log entry title for the routine's test state, e.g.
     "sysid-test-state-subsystem".
