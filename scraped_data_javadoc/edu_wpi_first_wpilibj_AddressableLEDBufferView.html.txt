A view of another addressable LED buffer. Views CANNOT be written directly to an LED strip; the
 backing buffer must be written instead. However, views provide an easy way to split a large LED
 strip into smaller sections (which may be reversed from the orientation of the LED strip as a
 whole) that can be animated individually without modifying LEDs outside those sections.

Constructor Details
AddressableLEDBufferView
public
AddressableLEDBufferView
(B backingBuffer,
 int startingIndex,
 int endingIndex)
Creates a new view of a buffer. A view will be reversed if the starting index is after the
 ending index; writing front-to-back in the view will write in the back-to-front direction on
 the underlying buffer.
Type Parameters:
B
- the type of the buffer object to create a view for
Parameters:
backingBuffer
- the backing buffer to view
startingIndex
- the index of the LED in the backing buffer that the view should start from
endingIndex
- the index of the LED in the backing buffer that the view should end on

LEDWriter
backingWriter,
 int startingIndex,
 int endingIndex)
Creates a new view of a buffer. A view will be reversed if the starting index is after the
 ending index; writing front-to-back in the view will write in the back-to-front direction on
 the underlying buffer.
Parameters:
backingReader
- the backing LED data reader
backingWriter
- the backing LED data writer
startingIndex
- the index of the LED in the backing buffer that the view should start from
endingIndex
- the index of the LED in the backing buffer that the view should end on
Method Details
reversed
public
AddressableLEDBufferView
reversed
()
Creates a view that operates on the same range as this one, but goes in reverse order. This is
 useful for serpentine runs of LED strips connected front-to-end; simply reverse the view for
 reversed sections and animations will move in the same physical direction along both strips.
Returns:
the reversed view
getLength
public
int
getLength
()
Description copied from interface:
LEDReader
Gets the length of the buffer.
Specified by:

in interface
LEDReader
Returns:
the buffer length
