Different behaviors for how Epilogue will generate the names of logged data points. This only
 applies to automatically generated names; any specific name provided with
Enum.name()
will
 take precedence over an automatically generated name.

Enum Constant Details
USE_CODE_NAME
public static final
Logged.Naming
USE_CODE_NAME
Sets the default naming strategy to use the name of the element as it appears in source code.
 For example, a field
double m_x
would be labeled as
"m_x"
by default, and a
getX()
accessor would be labeled as
"getX"
.
USE_HUMAN_NAME
public static final
Logged.Naming
USE_HUMAN_NAME
Sets the default naming strategy to use a human-readable name based on the name of the name
 of the element as it appears in source code. For example, a field
double m_x
would be
 labeled as
"X"
by default, and a
getX()
accessor would also be labeled as
"X"
. Because logged names must be unique, this configuration would fail to compile
 and require either one of the fields to be excluded from logs (which, for simple accessors,
 would be ideal to avoid duplicate data), or to rename one or both elements so the logged data
 fields would have unique names.

valueOf
public static
Logged.Naming
valueOf
(
String
name)
Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
The string must match
exactly
an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this class.  (Extraneous whitespace characters are 
not permitted.)
Parameters:
name
- the name of the enum constant to be returned.
Returns:
the enum constant with the specified name
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException
- if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
NullPointerException
- if the argument is null
