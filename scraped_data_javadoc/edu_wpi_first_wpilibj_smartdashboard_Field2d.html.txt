2D representation of game field for dashboards.
An object's pose is the location shown on the dashboard view. Note that for the robot, this
 may or may not match the internal odometry. For example, the robot is shown at a particular
 starting location, the pose in this class would represent the actual location on the field, but
 the robot's internal state might have a 0,0,0 pose (unless it's initialized to something
 different).
As the user is able to edit the pose, code performing updates should get the robot pose,
 transform it as appropriate (e.g. based on wheel odometry), and set the new pose.
This class provides methods to set the robot pose, but other objects can also be shown by
 using the getObject() function. Other objects can also have multiple poses (which will show the
 object at multiple locations).
