public final class
CurrentUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of electric current dimension.
This is the base type for units of current dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for
Measure
:
Measure<CurrentUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Amps
and
Units.Milliamps
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
CurrentUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit
in class
Unit
Returns:
the base unit
mult
public
PowerUnit
mult
(
VoltageUnit
voltage,
String
name,
String
symbol)
Constructs a unit of power equivalent to this unit of electrical current multiplied by another
 unit of voltage. For example,
Amps.times(Volts)
will return a unit of power equivalent
 to one Watt;
Amps.times(Millivolts)
will return a unit of power equivalent to a
 milliwatt, and so on.
Parameters:
voltage
- the voltage unit to multiply by
name
- the name of the resulting unit of power
symbol
- the symbol used to represent the unit of power
Returns:
the power unit
of

of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

in class
Unit
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement.
Returns:
the measurement object

()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)
. Subclasses are encouraged to override this
 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:
