Class AngleUnit
java.lang.Object
edu.wpi.first.units.Unit
edu.wpi.first.units.AngleUnit
public final class
AngleUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of angular dimension.
This is the base type for units of angular dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for
Measure
:
Measure<AngleUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Degrees
and
Units.Radians
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
AngleUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:

Returns:
the base unit

Angle
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

in class
Unit
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement.
Returns:
the measurement object
ofBaseUnits
public

ofBaseUnits
(double baseUnitMagnitude)
Description copied from class:

Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

Parameters:
baseUnitMagnitude
- the magnitude in terms of the base unit
Returns:
the measurement object

mutable
(double initialMagnitude)
Description copied from class:

Creates a new mutable measurement that is initialized to the given magnitude in terms of this
 unit. Implementations are
strongly

Description copied from class:
Unit
Combines this unit with a unit of time. This often - but not always - results in a velocity.
 Subclasses should sharpen the return type to be unit-specific.

per
(U other)
Creates a ratio unit between this unit and an arbitrary other unit.
Type Parameters:
U
- the type of the other unit
Parameters:

AngleUnit
otherUnit)
Converts a measurement value in terms of another angle unit to this unit.
Parameters:
