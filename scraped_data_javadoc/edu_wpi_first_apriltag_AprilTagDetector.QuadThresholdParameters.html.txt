Field Details
minClusterPixels
public
int
minClusterPixels
Threshold used to reject quads containing too few pixels. Default is 300 pixels.
maxNumMaxima
public
int
maxNumMaxima
How many corner candidates to consider when segmenting a group of pixels into a quad. Default
 is 10.
criticalAngle
public
double
criticalAngle
Critical angle, in radians. The detector will reject quads where pairs of edges have angles
 that are close to straight or close to 180 degrees. Zero means that no quads are rejected.
 Default is 45 degrees.
maxLineFitMSE
public
float
maxLineFitMSE
When fitting lines to the contours, the maximum mean squared error allowed. This is useful in
 rejecting contours that are far from being quad shaped; rejecting these quads "early" saves
 expensive decoding processing. Default is 10.0.
minWhiteBlackDiff
public
int
minWhiteBlackDiff
Minimum brightness offset. When we build our model of black & white pixels, we add an
 extra check that the white model must be (overall) brighter than the black model. How much
 brighter? (in pixel values, [0,255]). Default is 5.
deglitch
public
boolean
deglitch
Whether the thresholded image be should be deglitched. Only useful for very noisy images.
 Default is disabled (false).
