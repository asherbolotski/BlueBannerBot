parameterize
(
Spline
spline)
Parametrizes the spline. This method breaks up the spline into various arcs until their dx, dy,
 and dtheta are within specific tolerances.
Parameters:
spline
- The spline to parameterize.
Returns:
A list of poses and curvatures that represents various points on the spline.
Throws:
SplineParameterizer.MalformedSplineException
- When the spline is malformed (e.g. has close adjacent points
     with approximately opposing headings)

 double t1)
Parametrizes the spline. This method breaks up the spline into various arcs until their dx, dy,
 and dtheta are within specific tolerances.
Parameters:
spline
- The spline to parameterize.
t0
- Starting internal spline parameter. It is recommended to use 0.0.
t1
- Ending internal spline parameter. It is recommended to use 1.0.
Returns:
A list of poses and curvatures that represents various points on the spline.
Throws:
SplineParameterizer.MalformedSplineException
- When the spline is malformed (e.g. has close adjacent points
     with approximately opposing headings)
