ProfiledPIDSubsystem
extends
SubsystemBase
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Use a ProfiledPIDController instead
A subsystem that uses a
ProfiledPIDController
to control an output. The controller is run
 synchronously from the subsystem's periodic() method.
This class is provided by the NewCommands VendorDep

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Description copied from interface:
Subsystem
This method is called periodically by the
CommandScheduler
. Useful for updating
 subsystem-specific state that you don't want to offload to a
Command
. Teams should try
 to be consistent within their own codebases about which responsibilities will be handled by
 Commands, and which will be handled here.
getController
public
ProfiledPIDController
getController
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the ProfiledPIDController.
Returns:
The controller.
setGoal
public final
void
setGoal
(
TrapezoidProfile.State
goal)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the goal state for the subsystem.
Parameters:
goal
- The goal state for the subsystem's motion profile.
setGoal
public final
void
setGoal
(double goal)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the goal state for the subsystem. Goal velocity assumed to be zero.
Parameters:
goal
- The goal position for the subsystem's motion profile.
useOutput
protected abstract
void
useOutput
(double output,
TrapezoidProfile.State
setpoint)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Uses the output from the ProfiledPIDController.
Parameters:
output
