Command
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Use a ProfiledPIDController instead
A command that controls an output with a
ProfiledPIDController
. Runs forever by default -
 to add exit conditions and/or other behavior, subclass this class. The controller calculation and
 output are performed synchronously in the command's execute() method.
