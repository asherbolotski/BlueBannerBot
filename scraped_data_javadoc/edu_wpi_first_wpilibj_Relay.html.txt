Class for VEX Robotics Spike style relay outputs. Relays are intended to be connected to Spikes
 or similar relays. The relay channels controls a pair of channels that are either both off, one
 on, the other on, or both on. This translates into two Spike outputs at 0v, one at 12v and one at
 0v, one at 0v and the other at 12v, or two Spike outputs at 12V. This allows off, full forward,
 or full reverse control of motors without variable speed. It also allows the two channels
 (forward and reverse) to be used independently for something that does not care about voltage
 polarity (like a solenoid).

Constructor Details
Relay
public
Relay
(int channel,
Relay.Direction
direction)
Relay constructor given a channel.
Parameters:
channel
- The channel number for this relay (0 - 3).
direction
- The direction that the Relay object will control.
Relay
public
Relay
(int channel)
Relay constructor given a channel, allowing both directions.
Parameters:
channel
- The channel number for this relay (0 - 3).
Method Details
close

in interface
AutoCloseable
set
public
void
set
(
Relay.Value
value)
Set the relay state.
Valid values depend on which directions of the relay are controlled by the object.
When set to kBothDirections, the relay can be set to any of the four states: 0v-0v, 12v-0v,
 0v-12v, 12v-12v
When set to kForwardOnly or kReverseOnly, you can specify the constant for the direction, or
 you can simply specify kOff and kOn. Using only kOff and kOn is recommended.
Parameters:
value
- The state to set the relay.
get
public
Relay.Value
get
()
Get the Relay State.
Gets the current state of the relay.
When set to kForwardOnly or kReverseOnly, value is returned as kOn/kOff not
 kForward/kReverse (per the recommendation in Set)
Returns:
The current state of the relay as a Relay::Value
getChannel
public
int
getChannel
()
Get the channel number.
Returns:
The channel number.
