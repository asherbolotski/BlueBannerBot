public final class
TemperatureUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of temperature dimension.
This is the base type for units of temperature dimension. It is also used to specify the
 dimension for
Measure
:
Measure<TemperatureUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Celsius
and
Units.Fahrenheit
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
TemperatureUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:

Returns:
the base unit

of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
Unit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

in class
Unit
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement.
Returns:
the measurement object

Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit's base unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Specified by:

()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
Unit.of(double)

 method to sharpen the return type.
Overrides:

Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets a measure with a magnitude of 1.0 in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed
 to be of the same type returned by
