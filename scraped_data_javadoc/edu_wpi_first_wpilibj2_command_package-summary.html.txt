Description
Command
A state machine representing a complete action to be performed by the robot.
Command.InterruptionBehavior
An enum describing the command's behavior when another command with a shared requirement is
 scheduled.
Commands
Namespace for command factory methods.
CommandScheduler
The scheduler responsible for running
Command
s.
ConditionalCommand
A command composition that runs one of two commands, depending on the value of the given
 condition when this command is initialized.
DeferredCommand
Defers Command construction to runtime.
FunctionalCommand
A command that allows the user to pass in functions for each of the basic command methods through
 the constructor.
InstantCommand
A Command that runs instantly; it will initialize, execute once, and end on the same iteration of
 the scheduler.
MecanumControllerCommand
A command that uses two PID controllers (
PIDController
) and a ProfiledPIDController
 (
ProfiledPIDController
) to follow a trajectory
Trajectory
with a mecanum drive.
MecanumControllerCommand.MecanumVoltagesConsumer
A consumer to represent an operation on the voltages of a mecanum drive.
NotifierCommand
A command that starts a notifier to run the given runnable periodically in a separate thread.
ParallelCommandGroup
A command composition that runs a set of commands in parallel, ending when the last command ends.
ParallelDeadlineGroup
A command composition that runs a set of commands in parallel, ending only when a specific
 command (the "deadline") ends, interrupting all other commands that are still running at that
 point.
ParallelRaceGroup
A composition that runs a set of commands in parallel, ending when any one of the commands ends
 and interrupting all the others.

ProxyCommand
Schedules a given command when this command is initialized and ends when it ends, but does not
 directly run it.
RamseteCommand
A command that uses a RAMSETE controller (
RamseteController
) to follow a trajectory
Trajectory
with a differential drive.
RepeatCommand
A command that runs another command repeatedly, restarting it when it ends, until this command is
 interrupted.
RunCommand
A command that runs a Runnable continuously.
ScheduleCommand
Schedules the given commands when this command is initialized.
SelectCommand
<K>
A command composition that runs one of a selection of commands using a selector and a key to
 command mapping.
SequentialCommandGroup
A command composition that runs a list of commands in sequence.
StartEndCommand
A command that runs a given runnable when it is initialized, and another runnable when it ends.
Subsystem
A robot subsystem.
SubsystemBase
A base for subsystems that handles registration in the constructor, and provides a more intuitive
 method for setting the default command.
SwerveControllerCommand
A command that uses two PID controllers (
PIDController
) and a ProfiledPIDController
 (
ProfiledPIDController
) to follow a trajectory
Trajectory
with a swerve drive.

WaitCommand
A command that does nothing but takes a specified amount of time to finish.
WaitUntilCommand
A command that does nothing but ends after a specified match time or condition.
WrapperCommand
A class used internally to wrap commands while overriding a specific method; all other methods
 will call through to the wrapped command.
