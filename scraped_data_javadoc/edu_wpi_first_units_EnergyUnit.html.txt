public final class
EnergyUnit
extends
Unit
Unit of energy dimension.
This is the base type for units of energy dimension. It is also used to specify the dimension
 for
Measure
:
Measure<EnergyUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Joules
and
Units.Kilojoules
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
getBaseUnit
public
EnergyUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:
getBaseUnit

Unit
Returns:
the base unit
per
public
PowerUnit
per
(
TimeUnit
period)
Combines this unit of energy with a unit of time to create a unit of power.
Specified by:

in class
Unit
Parameters:
period
- the period of the change in energy
Returns:
the combined unit of power
per
public
<U extends

U>
per
(U other)
Creates a ratio unit between this unit and an arbitrary other unit.
Type Parameters:
U
- the type of the other unit
Parameters:
other
- the other unit
Returns:
the ratio unit
convertFrom
public
double
convertFrom
(double magnitude,
EnergyUnit
otherUnit)
Converts a measurement value in terms of another unit to this unit.
Parameters:
magnitude
- the magnitude of the measurement in terms of the other unit
otherUnit
- the other unit
Returns:

Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
