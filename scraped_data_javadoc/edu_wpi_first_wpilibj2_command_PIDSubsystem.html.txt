PIDSubsystem
extends
SubsystemBase
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Use a PIDController instead
A subsystem that uses a
PIDController
to control an output. The controller is run
 synchronously from the subsystem's periodic() method.
This class is provided by the NewCommands VendorDep

Constructor Details
PIDSubsystem
public
PIDSubsystem
(
PIDController
controller,
 double initialPosition)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Creates a new PIDSubsystem.
Parameters:
controller
- the PIDController to use
initialPosition
- the initial setpoint of the subsystem
PIDSubsystem
public
PIDSubsystem
(
PIDController
controller)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Creates a new PIDSubsystem. Initial setpoint is zero.
Parameters:
controller
- the PIDController to use
Method Details
periodic
public
void
periodic
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Description copied from interface:
Subsystem
This method is called periodically by the
CommandScheduler
. Useful for updating
 subsystem-specific state that you don't want to offload to a
Command
. Teams should try
 to be consistent within their own codebases about which responsibilities will be handled by
 Commands, and which will be handled here.
getController
public
PIDController
getController
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the PIDController.
Returns:
The controller.
setSetpoint
public final
void
setSetpoint
(double setpoint)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Sets the setpoint for the subsystem.
Parameters:
setpoint
- the setpoint for the subsystem
getSetpoint
public
double
getSetpoint
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the current setpoint of the subsystem.
Returns:
The current setpoint
useOutput
protected abstract
void
useOutput
(double output,
 double setpoint)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Uses the output from the PIDController.
Parameters:
output
- the output of the PIDController
setpoint
- the setpoint of the PIDController (for feedforward)
getMeasurement
protected abstract

getMeasurement
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Returns the measurement of the process variable used by the PIDController.
Returns:
the measurement of the process variable
enable
public
void
enable
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Enables the PID control. Resets the controller.
disable
public
void
disable
()
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
Disables the PID control. Sets output to zero.
