Class for mecanum drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the robot's position on the field
 over a course of a match using readings from your mecanum wheel encoders.
This class is meant to be an easy replacement for
MecanumDriveOdometry
, only requiring
 the addition of appropriate conversions between 2D and 3D versions of geometry classes. (See
Pose3d(Pose2d)
,
Rotation3d(Rotation2d)
,
Translation3d(Translation2d)
, and
Pose3d.toPose2d()
.)
Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like path following.
 Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation when using computer-vision systems.
