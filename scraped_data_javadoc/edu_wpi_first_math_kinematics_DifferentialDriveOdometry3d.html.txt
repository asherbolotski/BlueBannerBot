Class for differential drive odometry. Odometry allows you to track the robot's position on the
 field over the course of a match using readings from 2 encoders and a gyroscope.
This class is meant to be an easy replacement for
DifferentialDriveOdometry
, only
 requiring the addition of appropriate conversions between 2D and 3D versions of geometry classes.
 (See
Pose3d(Pose2d)
,
Rotation3d(Rotation2d)
,
Translation3d(Translation2d)
, and
Pose3d.toPose2d()
.)
Teams can use odometry during the autonomous period for complex tasks like path following.
 Furthermore, odometry can be used for latency compensation when using computer-vision systems.
It is important that you reset your encoders to zero before using this class. Any subsequent
 pose resets also require the encoders to be reset to zero.

Resets the robot's position on the field.
The gyroscope angle does not need to be reset here on the user's robot code. The library
 automatically takes care of offsetting the gyro angle.
Parameters:
gyroAngle
- The angle reported by the gyroscope.
leftDistanceMeters
- The distance traveled by the left encoder.
rightDistanceMeters
- The distance traveled by the right encoder.
poseMeters
- The position on the field that your robot is at.

Parameters:

- The angle reported by the gyroscope.

update
(
Rotation3d
gyroAngle,
 double leftDistanceMeters,
 double rightDistanceMeters)
Updates the robot position on the field using distance measurements from encoders. This method
 is more numerically accurate than using velocities to integrate the pose and is also
 advantageous for teams that are using lower CPR encoders.
Parameters:
gyroAngle
- The angle reported by the gyroscope.
leftDistanceMeters
- The distance traveled by the left encoder.
rightDistanceMeters
- The distance traveled by the right encoder.
Returns:
The new pose of the robot.
