FloatConsumer
Represents an operation that accepts a single float-valued argument and returns no result. This
 is the primitive type specialization of
Consumer
for float. Unlike
 most other functional interfaces, BooleanConsumer is expected to operate via side effects.
This is a functional interface whose functional method is
accept(float)
.
