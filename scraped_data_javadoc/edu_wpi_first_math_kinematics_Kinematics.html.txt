Interpolator
<P>
Helper class that converts a chassis velocity (dx and dtheta components) into wheel speeds. Robot
 code should not use this directly- Instead, use the particular type for your drivetrain (e.g.,
DifferentialDriveKinematics
).

Method Details
toChassisSpeeds
ChassisSpeeds
toChassisSpeeds
(
S
wheelSpeeds)
Performs forward kinematics to return the resulting chassis speed from the wheel speeds. This
 method is often used for odometry -- determining the robot's position on the field using data
 from the real-world speed of each wheel on the robot.
Parameters:
wheelSpeeds
- The speeds of the wheels.
Returns:
The chassis speed.
toWheelSpeeds
S
toWheelSpeeds
(
ChassisSpeeds
chassisSpeeds)
Performs inverse kinematics to return the wheel speeds from a desired chassis velocity. This
 method is often used to convert joystick values into wheel speeds.
Parameters:
chassisSpeeds
- The desired chassis speed.
Returns:
The wheel speeds.
toTwist2d
Twist2d
toTwist2d
(
P
start,
P
end)
Performs forward kinematics to return the resulting Twist2d from the given change in wheel
 positions. This method is often used for odometry -- determining the robot's position on the
 field using changes in the distance driven by each wheel on the robot.
Parameters:
start
- The starting distances driven by the wheels.
end
- The ending distances driven by the wheels.
Returns:
The resulting Twist2d in the robot's movement.
copy
P
copy
(
P
positions)
Returns a copy of the wheel positions object.
Parameters:
positions
- The wheel positions object to copy.
Returns:
A copy.
copyInto
void
copyInto
(
P
positions,
P
output)
Copies the value of the wheel positions object into the output.
Parameters:
positions
- The wheel positions object to copy. Will not be modified.
output
- The output variable of the copy operation. Will have the same value as the
     positions object after the call.
