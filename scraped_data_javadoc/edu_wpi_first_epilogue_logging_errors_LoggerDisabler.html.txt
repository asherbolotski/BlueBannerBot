All Implemented Interfaces:
ErrorHandler
public class
LoggerDisabler
extends
Object
implements
ErrorHandler
An error handler that disables loggers after too many exceptions are raised. Useful when playing
 in matches, where data logging is less important than reliable control. Setting the threshold to
 ≤0 will cause any logger that encounters an exception whilst logging to immediately be disabled.
 Setting to higher values means your program is more tolerant of errors, but takes longer to
 disable, and therefore may have more sets of partial or incomplete data and may have more CPU
 overhead due to the cost of throwing exceptions.
