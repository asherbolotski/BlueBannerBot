Unit of resistance dimension.
This is the base type for units of resistance dimension. It is also used to specify the
 dimension for
Measure
:
Measure<ResistanceUnit>
.
Actual units (such as
Units.Ohms
and
Units.KiloOhms
) can be found in the
Units
class.

Method Details
combine
public static
ResistanceUnit
combine
(
VoltageUnit
voltage,
CurrentUnit
current)
Combines an voltage and a current unit to form a unit of resistance.
Parameters:
voltage
- the unit of voltage
current
- the unit of current
Returns:
the combined unit of resistance
getBaseUnit
public
ResistanceUnit
getBaseUnit
()
Description copied from class:
Unit
Gets the base unit of measurement that this unit is derived from. If the unit is the base unit,
 the unit will be returned.
NOTE:
Subclasses
must
override this method to provide the
 correct return type. Failing to do say will make unit combinations that use it break at
 runtime!
Unit baseUnit = new Unit(null, ...);
   baseUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit

   Unit derivedUnit = new Unit(baseUnit, ...);
   derivedUnit.getBaseUnit(); // returns baseUnit
Overrides:

Resistance
of
(double magnitude)
Description copied from class:
PerUnit
Creates a new immutable measurement of the given magnitude in terms of this unit.
 Implementations are
strongly
recommended to sharpen the return type to a
 unit-specific measurement implementation.
Note: When called on an object of type
PerUnit
(and
not
a subclass!), this
 method will always return a
Per
instance. If you want to
 avoid casting, use
PerUnit.ofNative(double)
that returns a
Per
instance directly.
Overrides:

Parameters:

- the magnitude of the measure
Returns:

Note: When called on an object of type

Gets a measure of zero magnitude in terms of this unit. The returned object is guaranteed to be
 of the same type returned by
