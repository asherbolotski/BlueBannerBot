Glass

Glass is a new dashboard and robot data visualization tool. Its GUI is extremely similar to that of the
Simulation GUI
. In its current state, it is meant to be used as a programmer’s tool rather than a proper dashboard in a competition environment.
Note
Glass will not be available within the list of dashboards in the NI Driver Station.
