SmartDashboard
ÔÉÅ
SmartDashboard is a simple and efficient dashboard that uses relatively few computer resources.  It does not have the fancy look or some of the features Shuffleboard has, but it displays network tables data with a variety of widgets without bogging down the driver station computer.
Warning
SmartDashboard is deprecated and will be removed for 2027 due to its usage of Network Tables v3. Users can find
