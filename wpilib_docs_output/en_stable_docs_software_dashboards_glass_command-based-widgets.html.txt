Widgets for the Command-Based Framework

Glass also has several widgets that are specific to the
command-based framework
. These include widgets to schedule commands, view actively running commands on a specific subsystem, or view the state of the
command scheduler
.
Command Selector Widget

The
Command Selector
widget allows you to start and cancel a specific instance of a command (sent over NetworkTables) from Glass. For example, you can create an instance of
MyCommand
and send it to SmartDashboard:
JAVA
MyCommand
command
=
new
MyCommand
(...);
SmartDashboard
.
putData
(
"My Command"
,
command
);
C++
#include
<frc/smartdashboard/SmartDashboard.h>
...
MyCommand
command
{...};
frc
::
SmartDashboard
::
PutData
(
"My Command"
,
&
command
);
PYTHON
from
wpilib
import
SmartDashboard
command
=
MyCommand
(
...
)
SmartDashboard
.
putData
(
"My Command"
,
command
)
Note
The
MyCommand
instance can also be sent using a lower-level NetworkTables API or using the
Shuffleboard API
. In this case, the
SmartDashboard
API was used, meaning that the
Command Selector
widget will appear under the
SmartDashboard
table name.
The widget has two states. When the command is not running, a
Run
button will appear – clicking it will schedule the command. When the command is running, a
Cancel
button, accompanied by
Running…
text, will appear (as shown above). This will cancel the command.
Subsystem Widget

The
Subsystem
widget can be used to see the default command and the currently scheduled command on a specific subsystem. If you are using the
SubsystemBase
base class, your subsystem will be automatically sent to NetworkTables over LiveWindow. To view this widget, look under the
LiveWindow
main table name in the
NetworkTables
menu.
Command Scheduler Widget

The
Command Scheduler
widget allows you to see all currently scheduled commands. In addition, any of these commands can be canceled from the GUI.
The
CommandScheduler
instance is automatically sent to NetworkTables over LiveWindow. To view this widget, look under the
LiveWindow
main table name in the
NetworkTables
menu.
