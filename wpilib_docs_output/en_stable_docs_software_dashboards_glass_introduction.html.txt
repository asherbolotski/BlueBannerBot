Introduction to Glass

Glass is a new dashboard and robot data visualization tool. It supports many of the same
widgets
that the Simulation GUI supports, including robot pose visualization and advanced plotting. In its current state, it is meant to be used as a programmer’s tool for debugging and not as a dashboard for competition use.
Opening Glass

Glass can be launched by selecting the ellipsis menu (
…
) in VS Code, clicking on
Start Tool
and then choosing
Glass
.
Note
You can also launch Glass directly by navigating to
~/wpilib/YYYY/tools
and running
Glass.py
(Linux and macOS) or by using the shortcut inside the WPILib Tools desktop folder (Windows).
Changing View Settings

The
View
menu item contains
Zoom

Clearing Application Data

Application data for Glass, including widget sizes and positions as well as other custom information for widgets is stored in a
glass.ini
file. The location of this file varies based on your operating system:
On Windows, the configuration file is located in
%APPDATA%
.
On macOS, the configuration file is located in
~/Library/Preferences
.
On Linux, the configuration file is located in
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME
or
~/.config
if the former does not exist.
The
glass.ini
configuration file can simply be deleted to restore Glass to a “clean slate”.
