Power Transmission

Hand in hand with choosing the correct motors for an application is transmitting that motor power to the place it’s needed. Using gears or chains and sprockets are two effective ways of matching the motor power to the application being driven. In this video, WPI Robotics Engineering PhD student Michael Delph talks about power transmission, including choosing correct gear or chain and sprocket ratios to get the maximum performance from your robot design.
