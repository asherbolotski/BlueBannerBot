Fasten Components

Using the Dual Lock or hardware, fasten all components to the board. Note that in many FRC games robot-to-robot contact may be substantial and Dual Lock alone is unlikely to stand up as a fastener for many electronic components. Teams may wish to use nut and bolt fasteners or (as shown in the image above) cable ties, with or without Dual Lock to secure devices to the board.
Attach Robot Side Battery Connector

Strip the other end of each wire, and crimp on a ring or fork terminal
Attach the terminal to the motor controller input terminals (red to +, black to -)
Weidmuller Connectors

A number of the CAN and power connectors in the system use a Weidmuller LSF series wire-to-board connector. There are a few things to keep in mind when using this connector for best results:
Wire should be 16 AWG (1.5
\(mm^2\)
) to 24 AWG (0.25
\(mm^2\)
) (consult rules to verify required gauge for power wiring)
Wire ends should be stripped approximately 5/16 (~8 mm)”
A ferrule can be added to reinforce the connection and prevent splaying, as shown in the video above.
To insert or remove the wire, press down on the corresponding “button” to open the terminal
After making the connection check to be sure that it is clean and secure:
Verify that there are no “whiskers” outside the connector that may cause a short circuit
Tug on the wire to verify that it is seated fully. If the wire comes out and is the correct gauge it needs to be inserted further and/or stripped back further. Occasionally the terminal may remain stuck open with the wire inserted and the button released even if the wire is stripped and inserted properly; in these cases wiggling the wire in and out a small amount will often allow the connector to latch shut and grip the wire.

Motor Controller Signal Wires

PWM
This section details how to wire the SPARK MAX controllers using PWM signaling. This is a recommended starting point as it is less complex and easier to troubleshoot than CAN operation. The SPARK MAXs (and many other FRC motor controllers) can also be wired using
CAN
which unlocks easier configuration, advanced functionality, better diagnostic data and reduces the amount of wire needed.
Requires: 4x SPARK MAX PWM adapters (if using SPARK MAX), 4x PWM cables (if controllers without integrated wires or adapters, otherwise optional), 2x PWM Y-cable (Optional)
Option 1 (Direct connect):
If using SPARK MAX, attach the PWM adapter to the SPARK MAX (small adapter with a 3 pin connector with black/white wires).
If needed, attach PWM extension cables to the controller or adapter. On the controller side, match the colors or markings (some controllers may have green/yellow wiring, green should connect to black).
Attach the other end of the cable to the roboRIO with the black wire towards the outside of the roboRIO. It is recommended to connect the left side to PWM 0 and 1 and the right side to PWM 2 and 3 for the most straightforward programming experience, but any channel will work as long as you note which side goes to which channel and adjust the code accordingly.
Option 2 (Y-cable):
If using SPARK MAX, attach the PWM adapter to the SPARK MAX (small adapter with a 3 pin connector with black/white wires).
If needed, attach PWM extension cables between the controller or adapter and the PWM Y-cable. On the controller side, match the colors or markings (some controllers may have green/yellow wiring, green should connect to black).
Connect 1 PWM Y-cable to the 2 PWM cables for the controllers controlling each side of the robot. The brown wire on the Y-cable should match the black wire on the PWM cable.
Connect the PWM Y-cables to the PWM ports on the roboRIO. The brown wire should be towards the outside of the roboRIO. It is recommended to connect the left side to PWM 0 and the right side to PWM 1 for the most straightforward programming experience, but any channel will work as long as you note which side goes to which channel and adjust the code accordingly.
CAN
The Spark MAX controllers can also be wired using CAN. When wiring CAN the objective is to create a single complete bus running from the roboRIO on one end and running through all CAN devices on the robot. It is recommended to have either Power Distribution device at the other end of the bus because they have built-in termination. If you do not wish to locate one of these devices at the end of the bus see
CAN Wiring Basics
for info about terminating yourself.
The Spark MAX controllers come with CAN cables that are pre-terminated with connectors. You can chain these cables together directly, or buy or build extension cables to bridge larger gaps. To connect to other CAN devices such as pneumatics controllers, power distribution boards, or the roboRIO you will need to either cut off one of these pre-terminated connectors on the controller, cut off a connector on an extension, or build your own extension with just a single connector.
When chaining controllers together using the provided connectors, make sure to use the provided retaining clip. If unavailable, secure the connection with a small ziptie, electrical tape, or other similar method.
Robot Signal Light

Requires: Wire stripper, 2 pin cable, Robot Signal Light, 18 AWG (1
\(mm^2\)
) red wire, very small flat screwdriver
Cut one end off of the 2 pin cable and strip both wires
Insert the black wire into the center, “N” terminal and tighten the terminal.
Strip the 18 AWG (1
\(mm^2\)
) red wire and insert into the “La” terminal and tighten the terminal.
Cut and strip the other end of the 18 AWG (1
\(mm^2\)
) wire to insert into the “Lb” terminal
Insert the red wire from the two pin cable into the “Lb” terminal with the 18 AWG (1
\(mm^2\)
) red wire and tighten the terminal.
Connect the two-pin connector to the RSL port on the roboRIO. The black wire should be closest to the outside of the roboRIO.
Tip
You may wish to temporarily secure the RSL to the control board using cable ties or Dual Lock (it is recommended to move the RSL to a more visible location as the robot is being constructed)
Circuit Breakers

REV
Requires: 4x 40A circuit breakers
Insert 40-amp Circuit Breakers into the positions on the PDH corresponding with the Wago connectors the motor controllers are connected to. Note that the white graphic indicates which breakers are associated with which terminal pairs.
If working on a Robot Quick Build, stop here and insert the board into the robot chassis before continuing.
CTR
Requires: 4x 40A circuit breakers
Insert 40-amp Circuit Breakers into the positions on the PDP corresponding with the Wago connectors the motor controllers are connected to. Note that, for all breakers, the breaker corresponds with the nearest positive (red) terminal (see graphic above). All negative terminals on the board are directly connected internally.
If working on a Robot Quick Build, stop here and insert the board into the robot chassis before continuing.
Motor Power

Requires: Wire stripper, wire crimper, phillips head screwdriver, wire connecting hardware
For each
CIM
motor:
Strip the ends of the red and black wires from the CIM
For integrated wire controllers including SPARK MAX (top image):
Strip the red and black wires (or white and green wires) from the controller (the SPARK MAX white wire is unused for brushed motors such as the CIM, it should be secured and the end should be insulated such with electrical tape or other insulation method).
Connect the motor wires to the matching controller output wires (for controllers with white/green, connect red to white and green to black). The images above show an example using quick disconnect terminals which are provided in the Rookie KOP.
For the SPARK or other non-integrated-wire controllers (bottom image):
Crimp a ring/fork terminal on each of the motor wires.
Attach the wires to the output side of the motor controller (red to +, black to -)
STOP

Danger
Before plugging in the battery, make sure all connections have been made with the proper polarity. Ideally have someone that did not wire the robot check to make sure all connections are correct.
Start with the battery and verify that the red wire is connected to the positive terminal
Check that the red wire passes through the main breaker and to the + terminal of the PDP and that the black wire travels directly to the - terminal.
For each motor controller, verify that the red wire goes from the red PDP terminal to the V+ terminal on the motor controller (not M+!!!!)
For each non-motor controller device, verify that the red wire runs from a red terminal on the PD connects to a red terminal on the component.
Tip
It is also recommended to put the robot on blocks so the wheels are off the ground before proceeding. This will prevent any unexpected movement from becoming dangerous.
Manage Wires

Requires: Zip ties
Tip
Now may be a good time to add a few zip ties to manage some of the wires before proceeding. This will help keep the robot wiring neat.
Connect Battery

Connect the battery to the robot side of the Anderson connector. Power on the robot by moving the lever on the top of the 120A main breaker into the ridge on the top of the housing.
If stuff blinks, you probably did it right. If you hear any clicking, or see any smoke, power the system off immediately, clicking is likely the sound of circuit breakers tripping.
Before moving on, if using SPARK MAX controllers, there is one more configuration step to complete. The SPARK MAX motor controllers are configured to control a brushless motor by default. You can verify this by checking that the light on the controller is blinking either cyan or magenta (indicating brushless brake or brushless coast respectively). To change to brushed mode, press and hold the mode button for 3-4 seconds until the status LED changes color. The LED should change to either blue or yellow, indicating that the controller is in brushed mode (brake or coast respectively). To change the brake or coast mode, which controls how quickly the motor slows down when a neutral signal is applied, press the mode button briefly.
Tip
For more information on the SPARK MAX motor controllers, including how to test your motors/controllers without writing any code by using the REV Hardware Client, see the
SPARK MAX Quickstart guide
.
From here, you should connect to the roboRIO and try uploading your code!
