Drivetrain Simulation Tutorial

This is a tutorial for implementing a simulation model of your differential drivetrain using the simulation classes. Although the code that we will cover in this tutorial is framework-agnostic, there are two full examples available – one for each framework.
StateSpaceDifferentialDriveSimulation
(
Java
,
C++
) uses the command-based framework.
SimpleDifferentialDriveSimulation
(
Java
,
C++
) uses a more traditional approach to data flow.
Both of these examples are also available in the VS Code
New Project
window.
