Third-Party CAN Devices

A number of FRC® vendors offer their own
CAN
peripherals.  As CAN devices
offer expansive feature-sets, vendor CAN devices require similarly
expansive code libraries to operate.  As a result, these libraries are
not maintained as an official part of WPILib, but are instead maintained
by the vendors themselves.  For a guide to installing third-party
libraries, see
3rd Party Libraries
A list of common third-party CAN devices from various vendors, along with links to corresponding external documentation, is provided below:
