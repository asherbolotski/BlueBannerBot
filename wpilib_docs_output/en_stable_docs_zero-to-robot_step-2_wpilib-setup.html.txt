WPILib Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through installing the WPILib development environment on your computer. This includes the WPILib tools, Visual Studio Code, and all dependencies needed to develop and deploy code to the roboRIO. WPILib Installation is required for Java and C++ teams. LabVIEW teams can skip to
Installing LabVIEW for FRC (LabVIEW only)
. Python teams can do a full install per these instructions to get a Visual Studio Code environment with some python extensions, or do a tools only installation to install dashboards such as Shuffleboard and Elastic. Python teams additionally need to follow the
Python Installation Guide
.
Prerequisites

Supported Operating Systems and Architectures:
Windows 10 & 11, 64 bit only. 32 bit and Arm are not supported
Ubuntu 22.04 & 24.04, 64 bit. Other Linux distributions with glibc >= 2.34 may work, but are unsupported
macOS 13.3 or higher, both Intel and Arm.
Warning
The following OSes are no longer supported: macOS 12 or earlier, Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and any 32-bit Windows.
Note
Windows 10 support from Microsoft will end in October 2025
. We intend to continue supporting Windows 10 through the 2026 season, but may have to drop support in 2027. Teams should start planning their upgrade path to Windows 11, or switch to one of the supported Linux distributions listed.
Note
C++ compilation is memory intensive. A minimum of 32 GB of RAM is recommended for C++ teams.
This tutorial shows Windows 11, but the steps are identical for all operating systems. Notes differentiating operating systems will be shown.
WPILib is designed to install to different folders for different years, so that it is not necessary to uninstall a previous version before installing this year’s WPILib.

Release Notes
This is an update release of WPILib for the 2025 season. This release fixes an issue with rebooting robot code causing periodic CPU spikes that could cause loop overruns, upgrades Elastic to 2025.2.0 (fixes several camera viewer issues) and AdvantageScope to 4.1.5, and has a number of other quality of life improvements and fixes.  This upgrade is recommended for all teams.
Upgrading from earlier 2025 releases is easy: simply download and run the new installer and it will update your current installation. If you already have the 2025 WPILib vscode installed, it will detect it and you can simply click "next" for that installation step. After installation, vscode will prompt you when opening your robot project whether you want to upgrade it to this version. Note that using the installer is required to get the new version of desktop tools such as Elastic and AdvantageScope.  This release is compatible with the kickoff release of the RoboRIO image, so there is no need to upgrade the RIO image if you have already done so for 2025.
The documentation for WPILib is located at https://docs.wpilib.org/ (if you have trouble accessing this location, https://frcdocs.wpi.edu/en/stable/ is an alternate location with the same content).
If you're new to FRC, start with
Getting Started
.
System Requirements: WPILib requires 64-bit Windows 10 or 11 (Arm and 32-bit are not supported), Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, or macOS 13.3 or higher.  C++ teams should note that the latest version of Visual Studio 2022 is required for desktop builds.  Mac users will need to have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed before running the installer. This can be done by running
xcode-select --install
in the Terminal.
If you're returning from a previous season, check out
what's new for 2025
. You will need a new RoboRIO image for 2025; this is available via the
FRC 2025 Game Tools
. Follow the
WPILib installation guide
to install WPILib.
If you're starting from a 2024 robot project, you will need to
import your project
to create a 2025 project.  The import process is important, as it will make a few automated corrections for some breaking changes that happened in 2025.  It is also necessary to import vendor libraries again, since last year’s vendor libraries must be updated to be compatible with this year’s projects.
A complete list of known issues with this release can be found

You can download the latest release of the installer from GitHub
.
Once on the GitHub releases page, scroll to the Downloads section.
Then click on the correct binary for your OS and architecture to begin the download.
Extracting the Installer

When you download the WPILib installer, it is distributed as a disk image file
.iso
for Windows,
.tar.gz
for Linux, and distributed as a
DMG
for MacOS.
Windows 10+
Windows 10+ users can right click on the downloaded disk image and select
Mount
to open it. Then launch
WPILibInstaller.exe
.
Note
Other installed programs may associate with iso files and the
mount
option may not appear. If that software does not give the option to mount or extract the iso file, then follow the directions below.
You can use
7-zip
to extract the disk image by right-clicking, selecting
7-Zip
and selecting
Extract to…
. Windows 11 users may need to select
Show more options
at the bottom of the context menu.
After opening the
.iso
file, launch the installer by opening
WPILibInstaller.exe
.
Note
After launching the installer, Windows may display a window titled “Windows protected your PC”. Click
More info
, then select
Run anyway
to run the installer.
macOS
Note
Ensure you’ve ejected any previous WPILibInstaller images from the desktop before starting installation
macOS users can double click on the downloaded
dmg
and then select
WPILibInstaller
to launch the application.
If a warning is shown about WPILibInstaller being downloaded from the internet, select
Open
.
Linux
Linux users should extract the downloaded
.tar.gz
and then launch
WPILibInstaller
. Ubuntu treats executables in the file explorer as shared libraries, so double-clicking won’t run them. Run the following commands in a terminal instead with
<version>
replaced with the version you’re installing.
$
tar
-xf
WPILib_Linux-<version>.tar.gz
$
cd
WPILib_Linux-<version>/
$
./WPILibInstaller
Running the Installer

Upon opening the installer, you’ll be presented with the below screen. Go ahead and press
Start
.
This showcases a list of options included with the WPILib installation.
Tools Only
installs just the WPILib tools (
SmartDashboard
,
Shuffleboard
,
RobotBuilder
,
OutlineViewer
,
PathWeaver
,
Glass
,
SysId
,
Data Log Tool
,
roboRIO Team Number Setter
,
AdvantageScope
,
Elastic
,
WPIcal
) and JDK.
Everything
installs the full development environment (VS Code, extensions, all dependencies, C++ compiler and JDK), WPILib tools, and documentation
You will notice two buttons,
Install for this User
and
Install for all Users
.
Install for this User
only installs it on the current user account, and does not require administrator privileges. However,
Install for all Users
installs the tools for all system accounts and
will
require administrator access.
Install for all Users
is not an option for macOS and Linux.
Note
If you select Install for all Users, Windows will prompt for administrator access through UAC during installation.
Select the option that is appropriate for you, and you’ll presented with the following installation screen.
This next screen involves downloading VS Code. Unfortunately, due to licensing reasons, VS Code can not be bundled with the installer.
Download for this computer only
This downloads VS Code only for the current platform, which is also the smallest download.
Skip and don’t use VS Code
Skips installing VS Code. Useful for advanced installations or configurations. Generally not recommended.
Select existing VS Code archive for offline install on this computer
Selecting this option will bring up a prompt allowing you to select a pre-existing zip file of VS Code that has been downloaded by the installer previously. This option does
not
let you select an already installed copy of VS Code on your machine.
Create VS Code archives to share with other computers/OSes for offline install
This option downloads and saves a copy of VS Code for all platforms, which is useful for sharing with the installer for future offline installs.
Go ahead and select
Download for this computer only
. This will begin the download process and can take a bit depending on internet connectivity (it’s ~150MB). Once the download is done, select
Next
. You should be presented with a screen that looks similar to the one below.
Note
teams upgrading from Beta will already have a version of VS Code installed. However, it’s still recommended to select
Download for this computer only
to ensure the latest recommended version of VS Code is installed
After installation is complete, you will be presented with the finished screen.
Important
WPILib installs a separate version of VS Code. It does not use an already existing installation. Each year has it’s own copy of the tools appended with the year. IE:
WPILib
VS
Code
2025
. Please launch the WPILib VS Code and not a system installed copy!
Congratulations, the WPILib development environment and tooling is now installed on your computer! Press Finish to exit the installer.
Post-Installation

Some operating systems require some final action to complete installation.
macOS
After installation, the installer opens the WPILib VS Code folder. Drag the VS Code application to the dock.
Eject WPILibInstaller image from the desktop.
Linux
Some versions of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04 and later) require you to give the desktop shortcut the ability to launch. Right click on the desktop icon and select Allow Launching.
Ubuntu 23.10 and later
disable the kernel user namespaces feature for unknown applications
. This means that the
sandboxing feature
won’t work on the WPILib VS Code. To enable sandboxing for the WPILib applications, AppArmor profiles are provided, and can be installed using the command below.
$
sudo
cp
~/wpilib/YEAR/frccode/AppArmor/*
/etc/apparmor.d/
$
sudo
systemctl
reload
apparmor.service
The above will fix the following error:
The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that ~/wpilib/2025/advantagescope/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.
Note
Installing desktop tools and rebooting will create a folder on the desktop called
YYYY
WPILib
Tools
, where
YYYY
is the current year. Desktop tool shortcuts are not available on Linux and macOS.
Additional C++ Installation for Simulation

C++ robot simulation requires that a native compiler to be installed. For Windows, this would be
Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 or later
(
not
VS Code), macOS requires
Xcode 14 or later
, and Linux (Ubuntu) requires the
build-essential
package.
Ensure the
Desktop Development with C++
option is checked in the Visual Studio installer for simulation support.
What is Installed?

The Offline Installer installs the following components:
Visual Studio Code
- The supported IDE for 2019 and later robot code development. The offline installer sets up a separate copy of VS Code for WPILib development, even if you already have VS Code on your machine. This is done because some of the settings that make the WPILib setup work may break existing workflows if you use VS Code for other projects.
C++ Compiler
- The toolchains for building C++ code for the roboRIO
Gradle
- The specific version of Gradle used for building/deploying C++ or Java robot code
Java JDK/JRE
- A specific version of the Java JDK/JRE that is used to build Java robot code and to run any of the Java based Tools (Dashboards, etc.). This exists side by side with any existing JDK installs and does not overwrite the JAVA_HOME variable
WPILib Tools
