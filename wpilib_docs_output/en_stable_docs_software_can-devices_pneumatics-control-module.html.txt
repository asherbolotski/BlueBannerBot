Pneumatics Control Module

The Pneumatics Control Module (
PCM
) is a
CAN
-based device that provides complete control over the compressor and up to 8 solenoids per module. The PCM is integrated into WPILib through a series of classes that make it simple to use.
The closed loop control of the Compressor and Pressure switch is handled by the
Compressor
class (
Java
,
C++
,
Python
), and the Solenoids are handled by the
Solenoid
(
Java
,
C++
,
Python
) and
DoubleSolenoid
(
Java
,
C++
,
Python
) classes.
An additional PCM module can be used where the module’s corresponding solenoids are differentiated by the module number in the constructors of the Solenoid and Compressor classes.
