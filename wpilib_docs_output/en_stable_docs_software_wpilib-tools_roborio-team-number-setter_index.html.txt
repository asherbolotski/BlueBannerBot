roboRIO Team Number Setter

The roboRIO Team Number Setter is a cross-platform utility that can be used to set the team number on the roboRIO. It is an alternative to the roboRIO imaging tool for setting the team number.
In Visual Studio Code, press
Ctrl
+
Shift
+
P
and type
WPILib
or click the WPILib logo in the top right to launch the WPILib Command Palette. Select
Start Tool
, then select
roboRIOTeamNumberSetter
.
Connect to the roboRIO over USB to use the tool, as this is the simplest method when the team number hasn’t been set.
Setting Team Number

Enter your team number in the
Team Number
field and select
Set team to xxxxx
. This will take about a second, then press the
Reboot
button to reboot the roboRIO so the new team number takes effect.
Enabling/Disabling Webserver

The
roboRIO’s webserver
provides some debugging and enables some configuration. However, it also takes memory away from the robot program. You can disable it by clicking on the
Disable Web Server
button. If you’d like to enable it again, you can click
Enable Web Server
.
Warning
the Imaging Tool will not be able to connect to the roboRIO when the Web Server is disabled.
roboRIO Identification

Clicking the
Blink
button will cause the roboRIO’s Radio LED to blink a few times to help identify the roboRIO.
