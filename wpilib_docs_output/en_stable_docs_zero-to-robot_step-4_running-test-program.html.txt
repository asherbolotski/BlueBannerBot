Running your Test Program

Overview

You should create and download a Test Program as described for your programming language:
C++/Java/Python
LabVIEW
Tethered Operation

Running your test program while tethered to the Driver Station via ethernet or USB cable will confirm the program was successfully deployed and that the driver station and roboRIO are properly configured.
The roboRIO should be powered on and connected to the PC over Ethernet or USB.
Starting the FRC Driver Station

The FRC® Driver Station can be launched by double-clicking the icon on the Desktop or by selecting Start->All Programs->FRC Driver Station.
Setting Up the Driver Station

The DS must be set to your team number in order to connect to your robot. In order to do this click the Setup tab then enter your team number in the team number box. Press return or click outside the box for the setting to take effect.
PCs will typically have the correct network settings for the DS to connect to the robot already, but if not, make sure your Network adapter is set to
DHCP
.

See the article
Programming your radio
for details on configuring the second VH-109 for use as an access point.
After configuring the access point, connect the driver station via Ethernet to the VH-109 AP radio.
You can now confirm wireless operation using the same steps in
Confirm Connectivity
and
Operate the Robot
above.
