Option 3 - Running from the Script

The install process installs the tools to
~/wpilib/YYYY/tools
(where YYYY is the year and ~ is
C:\Users\Public
on Windows).
Inside this folder you will find
.vbs
(Windows) and
.sh
(macOS/Linux) files that you can use to launch each tool. These scripts help launch the tools using the correct JDK and are what you should use to launch the tools.
