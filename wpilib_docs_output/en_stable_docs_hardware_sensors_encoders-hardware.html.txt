Encoders are by far the most common method for measuring rotational motion in FRC®, and for good reason - they are cheap, easy-to-use, and reliable.  As they produce digital signals, they are less-prone to noise and interference than analog devices (such as
potentiometers
).
Types of Encoders

There are three main ways encoders connect physically that are typically used in FRC:
Shafted encoders
On-shaft encoders
Magnetic encoders
These encoders vary in how they are mounted to the mechanism in question.  In addition to these types of encoders, many FRC mechanisms come with quadrature encoders integrated into their design.
There are also three main ways the encoder data is communicated that are typically used in FRC:
Quadrature encoders
Duty Cycle encoders
Analog encoders
Note
Some encoders may support more then one communication method
Shafted Encoders

Shafted encoders have a sealed body with a shaft protruding out of it that must be coupled rotationally to a mechanism.  This is often done with a helical beam coupling, or, more cheaply, with a length of flexible tubing (such as surgical tubing or pneumatic tubing), fastened with cable ties and/or adhesive at either end.  Many commercial off-the-shelf FRC gearboxes have purpose-built mounting points for shafted encoders.
Examples of shafted encoders:
Grayhill 63r
US Digital MA3
On-shaft Encoders

On-shaft encoders couple to a shaft by fitting
around
it, forming a friction coupling between the shaft and a rotating hub inside the encoder.
Examples of On-shaft encoders:
AMT103-V

CIMcoder
REV Through Bore Encoder
US Digital E4T
Magnetic Encoders

Magnetic encoders require no mechanical coupling to the shaft at all; rather, they track the orientation of a magnet fixed to the shaft.  While the no-contact nature of magnetic encoders can be handy, they often require precise construction in order to ensure that the magnet is positioned correctly with respect to the encoder.

Quadrature Encoders

The term “quadrature” refers to the method by which the motion is measured/encoded.  A quadrature encoder produces two square-wave pulses that are 90-degrees out-of-phase from each other, as seen in the picture below:
Thus, across both channels, there are four total “edges” per period (hence “quad”).  The use of two out-of-phase pulses allows the direction of motion to be unambiguously determined from which pulse “leads” the other.
As each square wave pulse is a digital signal, quadrature encoders connect to the
digital input
ports on the roboRIO.

Quadrature Encoder Wiring

Quadrature Encoders, such as the
E4T OEM Miniature Optical Encoder
, can be wired to two digital input ports as shown above.
Index

Some quadrature encoders have a third index pin which pulses when the encoder completes a revolution.
Quaderature Encoder Resolution

Warning
The acronyms “CPR” and “PPR” are
both
used by varying sources to denote both edges per revolution
and
cycles per revolution, so the acronym alone is not enough to tell which is of the two is meant when by a given value.  When in doubt, consult the technical manual of your specific encoder.
As encoders measure rotation with digital pulses, the accuracy of the measurement is limited by the number of pulses per given amount of rotational movement.  This is known as the “resolution” of the encoder, and is traditionally measured in one of two different ways: edges per revolution, or cycles per revolution.
Edges per revolution
refers to the total number of transitions from high-to-low or low-to-high across both channels per revolution of the encoder shaft.  A full period contains
four
edges.
Cycles per revolution
refers to the total number of
complete periods
of both channels per revolution of the encoder shaft.  A full period is
one
cycle.
Thus, a resolution stated in edges per revolution has a value four times that of the same resolution stated in cycles per revolution.
In general, the resolution of your encoder in edges-per-revolution should be somewhat finer than your smallest acceptable error in positioning.  Thus, if you want to know the mechanism plus-or-minus one degree, you should have an encoder with a resolution somewhat higher than 360 edges per revolution.
Duty Cycle Encoders

Duty cycle encoders connect to a single digital input on the roboRIO. They output a pulse where the length of a pulse is proportional to the absolute position of the encoder.
Examples of duty cycle encoders:
AndyMark Mag Encoder
CTRE Mag Encoder
REV Through Bore Encoder
Team 221 Lamprey2
US Digital MA3
Analog Encoders

Analog encoders connect to a analog input on the roboRIO. They output a voltage proportional to the absolute position of the encoder.
