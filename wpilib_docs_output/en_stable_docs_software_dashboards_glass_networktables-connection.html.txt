Establishing NetworkTables Connections

Glass uses the
NetworkTables
protocol to establish a connection with your robot program. It is also used to transmit and receive data to and from the robot.
Connecting to a Robot

When Glass is first launched, you will see two widgets –
NetworkTables Settings
and
NetworkTables
. To connect to a robot, select
Client
under
Mode
in the
NetworkTables Settings
widget, enter your team number and click on
Apply
.
You can also connect to a robot that is running in simulation on your computer (including Romi robots) by typing in
localhost
into the
Team/IP
box.
Important
The NetworkTables connection status is always visible on the title bar of the Glass application.
Viewing NetworkTables Entries

The
NetworkTables
widget can be used to view all entries that are being sent over NetworkTables. These entries are hierarchically arranged by main table, sub-table, and so on.
Furthermore, you can view all connected NetworkTables clients under the
Connections
pane of the widget.
