Uninstall Old Versions (Recommended)

Important
LabVIEW teams have already completed this step, do not repeat it. LabVIEW teams should skip to the
Installation
section.
Before installing the new version of the FRC Game Tools it is recommended to remove any old versions. The new version will likely co-exist with the old version (note that the DS will overwrite old versions), but all testing has been done with FRC 2025 only.  Then click Start >> Add or Remove Programs. Locate the entry labeled “NI Software”, and select
Uninstall
.
Note
It is only necessary to uninstall previous versions when installing a new year’s tools (or when a beta is installed). For example, uninstall the 2021 tools before installing the 2022 tools. It is not necessary to uninstall before upgrading to a new update of the 2022 game tools.

. Wait for the uninstaller to complete and reboot if prompted.
