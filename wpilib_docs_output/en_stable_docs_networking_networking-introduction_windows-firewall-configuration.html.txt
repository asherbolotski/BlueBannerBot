Windows Firewall Configuration

Many of the programming tools used in FRC® need network access for various reasons. Depending on the exact configuration, the Windows Firewall may potentially interfere with this access for one or more of these programs.
Disabling Windows Firewall

Important
Disabling your firewall requires administrator privileges to the PC. Additionally note that disabling the firewall is not recommended for computers that connect to the internet.
The easiest solution is to disable the Windows Firewall. Teams should beware that this does make the PC potentially more vulnerable to malware attacks if connecting to the internet.
