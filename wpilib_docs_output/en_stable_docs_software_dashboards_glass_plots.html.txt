Plots

Glass excels at high-performance, comprehensive plotting of data from NetworkTables. Some features include resizable plots, plots with multiple y axes and the ability to pause, examine, and resume plots.
Creating a Plot

A new plot widget can be created by selecting the
Plot
button on the main menu bar and then clicking on
New Plot Window
. Several individual plots can be added to each plot window. To add a plot within a plot window, click the
Add plot
button inside the widget. Then you can drag various sources from the
NetworkTables
widget into the plot:
Manipulating Plots

You can click and drag on the plot to move around and scroll on top of the plot to zoom the y axes in and out. Double clicking on the graph will autoscale it so that the zoom and axis limits fit all of the data it is plotting.  Furthermore, right-clicking on the plot will present you with a plethora of options, including whether you want to display secondary and tertiary y axes, if you wish to lock certain axes, etc.
If you choose to make secondary and tertiary y axes available, you can drag data sources onto those axes to make their lines correspond with your desired axis:
Then, you can lock certain axes so that their range always remains constant, regardless of panning. In this example, the secondary axis range (with the
/SmartDashboard/Kp
entry) was locked between 9 and 12.
Plotting with AdvantageScope

AdvantageScope
is an alternative option for creating plots, including from data recorded to a log file using
WPILib data logs
. See the documentation for the
line graph
tab for more details.
