Path Planning

Path Planning is the process of creating and following trajectories. These paths use the WPILib trajectory APIs for generation and a
LTV Unicycle Controller
for following. This section highlights the process of characterizing your robot for system identification, trajectory following, and usage of PathWeaver. Users may also want to read the
generic trajectory following documents
for additional information about the API and non-commandbased usage.
Notice on Swerve Support

Swerve support in path following has a couple of limitations that teams need to be aware of:
WPILib currently does not support swerve in simulation, please see
this
pull request.
Pathweaver and Trajectory following currently do not incorporate independent heading. Path following using the WPILib trajectory framework on swerve will be the same as a DifferentialDrive robot. Both
Choreo
and
PathPlanner
have swerve support.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
