This section outlines the steps required to build a mecanum drivetrain using parts from the Mecanum Drivetrain Kit (
REV-45-1877
). The Mecanum Drivetrain Kit uses Belts and Pulleys rather than the standard Chain and Sprocket. For instructions on how to build a mecanum drivetrain with Chain and Sprocket instead checkout the
Channel Drivetrain - Mecanum Upgrade.
This design is a good starting point. However, modification maybe required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed.
The assembly of this drivetrain is broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each section begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of required materials for all sections is listed below.
