NEO Multi-Stage Assembly Instructions
For assembly you will need a 5/32" Allen Wrench.
1) Place the Universal Input Stage on the motor.
2) Align two of the mounting holes on the motor with the holes in the input stage.
3) Insert the 1/2in long 10-32 Socket Head Cap Screws in the motor mounting holes and tighten them down.
Note: It is a best practice to spin both screws all the way into the holes without tightening them and then alternate between tightening the two screws to snug them up.
4) Insert the 2mm key in the motor shaft keyway.
Note: The key should be located as close to the motor as the keyway will allow.
5) Align the key with the keyway in the Input Coupler.
6) Slide the Input Coupler on the motor shaft.  Ensure that the key is engaged and the Input Coupler has been slid all the way against the motor.
If your robot requires shaft retention in the gearbox, follow the
Shaft Retention Assembly
instructions now before proceeding.
When building your gearbox make sure the highest gear reduction is closest to the motor.
Greasing Guide
MAXPlanetary Gearbox Cartridges are pre-lubricated and sealed. If during maintenance you find that a cartridge needs more grease, we recommend using a Molybdenum Grease to apply more lubrication such as
Synthetic NLGI #2 Molybdenum Grease
or
MOLYKOTEÂ® G-2008 Synthetic Tool Gear Grease
.
7) Place the appropriate gear cartridge on the 1/2" Hex Socket Output.
Note: The cartridge may need to be rotated to get the splines to line up.  Once the splines are inserted continue to rotate the cartridge to ensure that the alignment features are completely engaged.
8) Continue stacking gear cartridges backwards towards the motor in the appropriate order.
Note: Ensure that the alignment features of each cartridge are properly engaged with the cartridges next to it.
9) Align the stacked output stage and gear cartridges with the input stage.
10a) Slide the stack of gear cartridges onto the motor shaft and input stage.  Ensure that the input spline on the rear gear cartridge and the input coupler are properly engaged.
Note: This may require twisting by hand the gear cartridges slightly to line up the splines and then rotating back once the spline is engaged.  Make sure the entire stack is pressed together and all alignment features are properly engaged.
10b) Gap - Having a gap in this location is bad. If a gap is present, it means that all alignment features are not properly engaged. This may require twisting by hand the gear cartridges slightly to line up the splines and then rotating back once the spline is engaged. Make sure the stack is fully seated and no gap is present before inserting and tightening the gearbox assembly screws
11) Insert the appropriate length of 10-32 Socket Head Cap Screws into the gearbox assembly holes
0 Cartridges: 1/2in Long Screws
1 Cartridge: 1in Long Screws
2 Cartridges: 1-1/2in Long Screws
3 Cartridges: 2in Long Screws
12) Tighten the gearbox assembly screws down.
Note: It is a best practice to spin both screws all the way into the holes without tightening them and then alternate between tightening the two screws to snug them up.
