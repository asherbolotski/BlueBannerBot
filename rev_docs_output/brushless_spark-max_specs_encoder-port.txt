Located on the motor output side of the SPARK MAX is a 6-pin Encoder Port. This port is designed to accept the built-in hall-encoder from the
NEO Brushless Motor
, but it can also connect to other external encoders when running in Brushed Mode. The connector details can be found below.
The SPARK MAX can be configured to run in
Alternate Encoder Mode
, which reconfigures the Data Port on the top of the controller to accept an alternative quadrature encoder in addition to the Encoder Port.
