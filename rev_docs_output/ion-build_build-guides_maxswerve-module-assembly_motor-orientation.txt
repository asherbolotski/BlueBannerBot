When assembling their 3in MAXSwerve Module, teams have a choice of either left-hand or right-hand assembly, meaning teams can choose which direction their motors' wires face.
Depending on the choice the team makes, your layout of the MAXSwerve may look like either of these, at various stages of the assembly process.
In our
3in MAXSwerve Drivetrain
example we chose two Left-Hand and two Right-Hand orientations to allow for clean wire management and a balanced drivetrain.
