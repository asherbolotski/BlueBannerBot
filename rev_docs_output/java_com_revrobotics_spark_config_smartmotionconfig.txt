Constructor Details
SmartMotionConfig
public
SmartMotionConfig
()
Create a new object to configure SmartMotion.
Method Details
apply
public
SmartMotionConfig
apply
(
SmartMotionConfig
config)
Applies settings from another
SmartMotionConfig
to this one.
Settings in the provided config will overwrite existing values in this object. Settings not
 specified in the provided config remain unchanged.
Parameters:
config
- The
SmartMotionConfig
to copy settings from
Returns:
The updated
SmartMotionConfig
for method chaining

SmartMotionConfig
maxVelocity
(double maxVelocity)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the maximum velocity for the Smart Motion mode of the controller. This is the cruising
 velocity of the profile. Natively, the units are in RPM but will be affected by the velocity
 conversion factor.
This will set the value for closed loop slot 0. To set the value for a specific closed loop
 slot, use
maxVelocity(double, ClosedLoopSlot)
.
Parameters:
maxVelocity
- The maximum velocity with the velocity conversion factor applied
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining

maxVelocity
(double maxVelocity,

slot)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the maximum velocity for the Smart Motion mode of the controller for a specific closed loop
 slot. This is the cruising velocity of the profile. Natively, the units are in RPM but will be
 affected by the velocity conversion factor.
Parameters:
maxVelocity
- The maximum velocity with the velocity conversion factor applied
slot
- The closed loop slot to set the values for
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining
maxAcceleration

public
SmartMotionConfig
maxAcceleration
(double maxAcceleration)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the maximum acceleration for the Smart Motion mode of the controller. This is the rate at
 which the velocity will increase until the max velocity is reached. Natively, the units are in
 RPM per second but will be affected by the velocity conversion factor.
This will set the value for closed loop slot 0. To set the value for a specific closed loop
 slot, use
maxAcceleration(double, ClosedLoopSlot)
.
Parameters:
maxAcceleration
- The maximum acceleration with the velocity conversion factor applied
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining
maxAcceleration

public
SmartMotionConfig
maxAcceleration
(double maxAcceleration,
ClosedLoopSlot
slot)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the maximum acceleration for the Smart Motion mode of the controller for a specific PID
 slot. This is the rate at which the velocity will increase until the max velocity is reached.
 Natively, the units are in RPM per second but will be affected by the velocity conversion
 factor.
Parameters:
maxAcceleration
- The maximum acceleration with the velocity conversion factor applied
slot
- The closed loop slot to set the values for
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining

public
SmartMotionConfig
minOutputVelocity
(double minVelocity)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the minimum velocity for the Smart Motion mode of the controller. Any requested velocities
 below this value will be set to 0. Natively, the units are in RPM but will be affected by the
 velocity conversion factor.
This will set the value for closed loop slot 0. To set the value for a specific closed loop
 slot, use
minOutputVelocity(double, ClosedLoopSlot)
.
Parameters:
minVelocity
- The minimum velocity with the velocity conversion factor applied
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining
minOutputVelocity
@Deprecated

public
SmartMotionConfig
minOutputVelocity
(double minVelocity,
ClosedLoopSlot
slot)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the minimum velocity for the Smart Motion mode of the controller for a specific closed loop
 slot. Any requested velocities below this value will be set to 0. Natively, the units are in
 RPM but will be affected by the velocity conversion factor.
Parameters:
minVelocity
- The minimum velocity with the velocity conversion factor applied
slot
- The closed loop slot to set the values for
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining

public
SmartMotionConfig
allowedClosedLoopError
(double allowedError)
Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the allowed closed loop error for the Smart Motion mode of the controller. This value is
 how much deviation from the setpoint is tolerated and is useful in preventing oscillation
 around the setpoint. Natively, the units are in rotations but will be affected by the position
 conversion factor.
This will set the value for closed loop slot 0. To set the value for a specific closed loop
 slot, use
allowedClosedLoopError(double, ClosedLoopSlot)
.
Parameters:
allowedError
- The allowed error with the position conversion factor applied
Returns:
The modified
SmartMotionConfig
object for method chaining

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.
It is recommended to migrate to MAXMotion instead.
Set the allowed closed loop error for the Smart Motion mode of the controller for a specific
 closed loop slot. This value is how much deviation from the setpoint is tolerated and is useful
 in preventing oscillation around the setpoint. Natively, the units are in rotations but will be
 affected by the position conversion factor.
Parameters:
