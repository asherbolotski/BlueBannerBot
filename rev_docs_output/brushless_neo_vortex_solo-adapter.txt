The NEO Vortex Solo Adapter (REV-11-2828), allows teams to seamlessly integrate the NEO Vortex Brushless Motor with a SPARK MAX. This adapter breaks out the motor sensor connector and phase wire connections for simple backward compatibility.
While the NEO Vortex Solo Adapter allows you to use the motor independently, it may not fully support certain advanced functionalities of the NEO Vortex Brushless Motor.

Docking a NEO Vortex Solo Adapter
When docked with a NEO Vortex Solo Adapter a NEO Vortex can be controlled with a SPARK MAX.
Docking Materials
Docking the NEO Vortex with the SPARK Flex is simple and only requires the following materials and tools:
NEO Vortex Brushless Motor
NEO Vortex Solo Adapter
Docking Hardware
4 - M3 x 25 mm Socket Head Screws (included with SPARK Flex)
2.5 mm Hex Key
Docking Procedure
Follow these steps to ensure a secure and proper docking:
Ensure that power is disconnected from the NEO Vortex Solo Adapter.
Align the motor phase bullets between the NEO Vortex and NEO Vortex Solo Adapter.
Allowing the bullets to guide the two together, press the NEO Vortex and NEO Vortex Solo Adapter together until their bodies meet. There may be a small gap between the motor and the controller opposite the bullets. This is normal.
Insert the included docking screws into the counterbored Docking Screw Clearance Holes on the NEO Vortex Solo Adapter.
Using the 2.5 mm Hex Key, tighten the four screws evenly in a crisscross pattern until the screws are tight and secure. The screw heads should be sub-flush from the mounting face of she NEO Vortex Solo Adapter. If you have a torque wrench, the ideal torque is 11.5 ±0.9 in-lb (1.3 ±0.1 Nm).
DO NOT
run the motor without the docking screws installed. These screws ensure a robust and secure electrical connection, and doing so may cause damage to the system.
Docking a NEO Vortex to a SPARK Flex/NEO VortexSolo Adapter
Undocking Procedure
Follow these steps to undock the NEO Vortex and NEO Vortex Solo Adapter:
Ensure that power is disconnected from the NEO Vortex Solo Adapter.
Completely remove the four docking screws from the assembly.
Gently pull the NEO Vortex and NEO Vortex Solo Adapter apart until the bullets release. Try to maintain their relative orientation to each other while pulling them apart.
