The REV Robotics Smart Robot Servo (SRS) (
REV-41-1097
) is a configurable metal-geared servo that takes the guesswork out of aligning and adjusting servo based mechanisms. One SRS can be used as a standard angular servo, a custom angular servo, and a continuous rotation servo by simply changing its settings
For more information on the Smart Robot Servo check out our
crossover documentation
on the SRS.

Servo Power Module
The REV Robotics SRS Programmer is the key to unlocking all the smart features of the Smart Robot Servo (SRS). Switching between continuous rotation, standard servo, and custom angular modes is easy as pressing a button. The SRS Programmer can not only program the SRS, but it is also acts as a standalone servo tester for any standard RC servo.
Check out our documentation of the
SRS Programmer
.
Servo Power Module
The REV Servo Power Module (
REV-11-1144
) is a 6V 90W power injector that enables the use of standard servos in applications where a robot controller cannot provide adequate power. The following Quick Start Guide describes the Servo Power Module features and the necessary information to get it up and running.
