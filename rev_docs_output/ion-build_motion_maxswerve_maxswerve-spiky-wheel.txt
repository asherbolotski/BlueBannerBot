Overview
The 3in MAXSwerve Spiky Wheel Tread is designed to be used with the 3in MAXSwerve Module. The Spikey tread provides superior grip and performance especially on carpet. The one-piece split tread design allows for quick and seamless replacements without the need to fully remove the wheel. As a consumable component, these treads are built for performance but will naturally wear down over time.

MAXSwerve Spiky Wheel Tread Evaluation
The MAXSwerve Spiky Wheel Tread is designed to be very durable and last for several matches of play. Determining when to replace the tread is highly dependent on the use case of the wheel. If you are seeing flat spots or uneven wear we recommend replacing your tread. For general use, if you are seeing a decrease of 1/8in in the diameter of wheel we recommend replacing the tread.
3in MAXSwerve Spiky Wheel Assembly
Threadlocker is highly recommended on all screws used in this assembly. We recommend
LOCTITEÂ® Threadlocker Blue 242
or an equivalent threadlocker.
1) Install a #10-32 3/8in button head screw in the center hole of the Spiky Tread and Spiky Wheel Aluminum Hub. Do not fully tighten this screw to allow the tread to flex.
2) Insert a second #10-32 3/8in button head screw in one end of the of the tread and wrap it around and install into the Hub. We recommend using a T-Handle Allen Wrench for the extra leverage. Bring the end of the screw into the corresponding hole on the aluminum hub. With a reasonable amount of force, stretch the tread as you bring it up and angle the screw into alignment with the hole, all while slightly spinning the screw counterclockwise or in the direction of loosening it. This is key to help seat the screw before trying to insert it all the way. With everything aligned, the screws should go in smoothly without any extra force.

Note: We recommend watching our

linked at the top of these instructions for additional tips and examples.
3) Insert a third #10-32 3/8in button head screw in the opposite end of the tread and the opposite corner as the previous screw.
4) Install the last two remaining #10-32 3/8in button head screws into the Spiky Tread and Spiky Wheel Aluminum Hub.
5) Tighten the #10-32 3/8in button head screw in the center hole to finish assembly.
