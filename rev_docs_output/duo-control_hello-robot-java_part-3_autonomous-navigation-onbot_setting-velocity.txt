Setting Velocity in our Program
Velocity is a closed loop control within the
SDK
that uses the encoder counts to determine the approximate power/speed the motors need to go in order to meet the set velocity.
To set a velocity, its important to understand the maximum velocity in RPM your motor is capable of. For the Class Bot V2 the motors are capable of a maximum RPM of 300. With a drivetrain, you are likely to get better control by setting velocity lower than the maximum. In this case, lets set the velocity to 175 RPM!
Since RPM is the amount of revolutions per minute, a conversion needs to be made from RPM to ticks per second (TPS). To do this, divide the RPM by 60 to get the amount of rotations per second.
Rotations per second can then be multiplied by
COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV
, to get the amount of ticks per second.

Adding Ticks per Second as a Variable
Create a new double variable called
TPS
. Add
TPS
the to the OpMode under where
rightTarget
is defined:
Copy
public
void
runOpMode()
{
leftmotor
=
hardwareMap
.
get
(
DcMotor
.
class
,
"leftmotor"
);
rightmotor
=
hardwareMap
.
get
(
DcMotor
.
class
,
"rightmotor"
);
rightmotor

setDirection
(
DcMotor
.

);
leftmotor
.
setMode
(

RunMode
.
STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER
);
rightmotor

setMode

.

);
int
leftTarget
=
(
int
)(
610
*
COUNTS_PER_MM);
int
rightTarget
=
(
int
)(
610
*
COUNTS_PER_MM);
double
TPS
=
(
175
/
60
)
*
COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV;
waitForStart()
;
Changing from Power to Velocity
Exchange the
setPower();
functions for
setVelocity();
Add
TPS
as the parameter for
setVelocity();
Copy
waitForStart();
leftmotor.setTargetPosition(leftTarget);
rightmotor.setTargetPosition(rightTarget);
leftmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
rightmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
leftmotor.setVelocity(TPS);
rightmotor.setVelocity(TPS);
while (opModeIsActive() && (leftmotor.isBusy() && rightmotor.isBusy())){
}
With the velocity set, let's give our program a test run after building!
DcMotor vs. DcMotorEx
With the current state of the code you are likely to get errors similar to the ones pictured below:
This is because the
setVelocity();
function is a function of the
DcMotorEx
Interface. The
DcMotorEx
Interface is an extension of the
DcMotor
Interface, that provides enhanced motor functionality, such as access to closed loop control functions.
To use
setVelocity();
the motor variables need to be changed to
DcMotorEx
as seen below:
Copy
public class HelloRobot_Encoder extends LinearOpMode {
private DcMotorEx leftmotor;
private DcMotorEx rightmotor;
Copy
public void runOpMode() {
leftmotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "leftmotor");
rightmotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "rightmotor");
Since
DcMotorEx
is an extension of
DcMotor
,
DcMotor
specific functions can be used by variables defined as
DcMotorEx
.

Copy

public class HelloRobot_Encoder extends LinearOpMode {
private DcMotorEx leftmotor;
private DcMotorEx rightmotor;

static final double     COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV    = COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV * DRIVE_GEAR_REDUCTION;
static final double     COUNTS_PER_MM           = COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV / WHEEL_CIRCUMFERENCE_MM;
@Override
public void runOpMode() {
leftmotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "leftmotor");
rightmotor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotorEx.class, "rightmotor");
rightmotor.setDirection(DcMotor.Direction.REVERSE);
leftmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER);
rightmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER);
int leftTarget = (int)(610 * COUNTS_PER_MM);
int rightTarget = (int)(610 * COUNTS_PER_MM);
double TPS = (175/ 60) * COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV;
waitForStart();
leftmotor.setTargetPosition(leftTarget);
rightmotor.setTargetPosition(rightTarget);
leftmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
rightmotor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
leftmotor.setVelocity(TPS);
rightmotor.setVelocity(TPS);
while (opModeIsActive() && (leftmotor.isBusy() && rightmotor.isBusy())) {
}
}
}
