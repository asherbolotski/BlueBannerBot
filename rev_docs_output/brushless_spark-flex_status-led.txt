12V Missing
The motor will not drive if powered only by USB. This blink code warns the user of this condition.
Orange/Blue Slow Blink
Sensor Fault
This can occur if the sensor type is misconfigured, the sensor cable is not plugged in or damaged, or if a sensor other than the motor sensor is plugged in.
Orange/Magenta Slow Blink
Gate Driver Fault
A fault reported by the core internal electronic circuitry. If this code persists after power cycling the controller, contact REV.
Orange/Cyan Slow Blink
CAN Fault
The CAN fault will be shown after the first time the device is plugged into the CAN port and a fault later occurs. Check your CAN wiring if you see this fault.
Orange/Yellow Slow Blink
Temperature Cutoff Fault
The motor or motor controller has gotten too hot to continue running. This fault will clear automatically after the system cools down enough to run again.
Orange/Green Slow Blink
