Connecting a SPARK MAX via USB
Connect your SPARK MAX Motor Controller to your computer with a USB C cable.
Open the REV Hardware Client application.
The Client should automatically scan and connect to your SPARK MAX
All SPARK MAX Motor Controllers comes with a USB C to USB A cable.
Additional SPARK MAX devices connected via CAN to the USB Host SPARK MAX are visible when using the latest firmware. For more information see the
SPARK MAX User's Manual.
Navigating the REV Hardware Client
The REV Hardware Client has four tabs to manage different features of the Client. The "Hardware Tab" is where supported hardware devices are managed. The "Utilities Tab" allows for viewing log files collected by the Control Hub or Driver Hub. The "Downloads Tab" allows for the downloading of supported device software for updating when offline. The "About Tab" has information on what devices are supported, updating the REV Hardware Client, and troubleshooting.
Individual devices, like the SPARK MAX, have additional tabs available when the device is selected. For a full overview of the default navigation features of the REV Hardware Client see the
User's Manual.
Below is more information on using the specific features for the SPARK MAX.
As of REV Hardware Client version 1.7.0, "Burn Flash" has been renamed to "Persist Perimeters"!
Hardware Tab
The Hardware Tab is used to select devices connected via USB or the USB to CAN bridge for configuration, updates, and more.
Once a SPARK MAX is selected from the Hardware tab a number of device specific tabs will show.
Basic Tab
The Basic Tab is used to set the most common parameters for the SPARK MAX.
Device Identify:
Blink the selected SPARK MAX's LED for identification.
CAN ID:
This assigns a SPARK MAX a CAN ID for identification over the CAN BUS. Any configured SPARK MAX
must have
a CAN ID.
Configurations:
This drop down allows you to select pre-existing configurations store on the Windows machine running the SPARK MAX Client or to pull the existing parameters stored on in RAM on the SPARK MAX. This is helpful when configuring multiple motor controllers to the same settings.
Configured Parameters:
Change the motor type, sensor type, idle mode behavior, and more.
Advanced Tab
The Advanced Tab allows for changing all configurable parameters of the SPARK MAX without needing to set them in code.
Search Parameters:
Allows for easy look up of a specific parameter for editing.
Parameter Table:
Select the arrow to show all configurable parameters within a specific group. For more information on each parameter type see
Configuration Parameters
.
Remember to burn the persist parameters to memory before disconnecting the SPARK MAX
Run Tab
The Run Tab allows for the SPARK MAX to operate over USB or a USB to CAN Bridge without the need for a full control system. This is helpful for testing mechanisms and tuning their control loops.
Run:
Choose setpoints to run a motor connected to a SPARK MAX using various modes, including position, velocity, and duty cycle.
PIDF:
Update PIDF parameters on the fly to tune control loops on the SPARK MAX.
View Graph:
Moves the Client over to the Telemetry Tab to show any added signals in graph form when running a SPARK MAX. This is helpful when tuning control loops.
Update Tab
The Update tab shows what version of firmware is on the selected device, if that device is up to date, and update the firmware of the selected device.
Download Latest Firmware:
Downloads latest firmware onto the local machine running the Client.
Update Firmware:
Updates the selected device with the latest firmware.
Out-of-date Firmware Warning:
Warning to alert the user there is new firmware available for any connected device.
For more information on the firmware updating process see Updating Device Firmware
