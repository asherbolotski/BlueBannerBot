The REV Robotics 2m Distance Sensor (
REV-31-1505
) uses the ST Microelectronics VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) laser-ranging module to measure distances up to 2m with millimeter resolution.
Unlike other ranging sensors that rely on the intensity of reflected light, this sensor can measure how long it takes for the light to bounce back, the “time of flight.” This results in much more accurate measurements that are independent of the target’s reflectance.
