The following tables provide the operating and mechanical specifications for the SPARK MAX Motor Controller.
DO NOT exceed the maximum electrical specifications. Doing so will cause permanent damage to the SPARK MAX and will void the warranty.

*Continuous operation at 60A may produce high temperatures on the heat sink. Caution should be taken when handling the SPARK MAX if it has been running at higher current level for an extended period of time.
If using a battery to power SPARK MAX, make sure the fully charged voltage is below 24V allowing for sustained operation. Some battery chemistries and configurations, including 6S LiPo packs, have a charge voltage above the maximum operating voltage for SPARK MAX.

Brushed: between A and B outputs at 100% duty. 
Brushless: A->B->C direction at 100% duty.
††
Neutral corresponds to zero output voltage (0 V) and is either braking or coasting depending on the current idle behavior mode.
†††
Brushed:  between A and B outputs at 100% duty.
Brushless: C->B->A direction at 100% duty.
‡
If a valid pulse isn't received within the timeout period, the SPARK MAX will disable its output.
‡‡
Input deadband is added to each side of the neutral pulse width. Within the deadband, output state is neutral. The deadband value is configurable using the REV Hardware Client or through the CAN interface.
