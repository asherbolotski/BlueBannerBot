The Digital LED Indicator (REV-31-2010) is a LED signal module that is digitally controlled (active low) and offers three colors: red, green, and amber. The Digital LED Indicator is designed to directly interface with the DIO ports of the Control Hub and Expansion Hub. When using the Digital LED Indicator outside of the REV Hub environment, make sure to check that your device GPIO pinsâ€™ current sink rating can handle 20mA.
