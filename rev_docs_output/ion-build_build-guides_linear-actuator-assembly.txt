Greasing Guide
When assembling the Linear Actuator we recommend adding grease during assembly and re-applying as needed for the maintenance of your mechanism. For most applications, using
White Lithium Grease
will provide sufficient lubrication.
When applying the grease of your choice, add a small amount to the lead screw, ensuring that it gets evenly distributed throughout the system by moving the lead screw nut up and down.
1) Screw the Lead Screw Nut onto the Lead Screw. Please reference the Greasing Guide.
2) Slide the Spacer onto the Lead Screw.
3) Add the Brass Stopper onto the Lead Screw. Tighten with a 2mm Allen Key. Please note, to adjust the extension length move the Brass Stopper up or down the Lead Screw.
4) Slide 1x1 MAXTube (REV-21-2160) onto the Lead Screw. Fasten the MAXTube with four #10-32 x 1/4in Button Head Hex Drive Screw and a 1/8in Allen Key.
5) Press the two 6904-2Z bearings into the End Cap. Press them in until you hit the stop in the End Cap.
6) Slide the End Cap and Bearings onto the Lead Screw. Fasten the Lead Screw with a Snap Ring and Snap Ring Pliers. Please make note of the orientation so that the grooves on the End Cap will line up with the grooves on the Housing in the next step.
7) Slide the Linear Actuator Housing onto the MAXTube and Lead Screw.
8) Slide the Top Cap onto the MAXTube and Lead Screw. Please make note of the orientation so that the grooves on the Top Cap line up with the grooves on the Housing.
9) Fasten the End Caps and Housing with eight #10-32 x1in Socket Head Screw and a 5/32in Allen Key.
NEO Brushless Motor and a single stage MAXPlanetary Gearbox
The Linear Actuator is ideally operated by a NEO Brushless Motor and a single stage
MAXPlanetary Gearbox
.
Cut the MAXPlanetary 1/2 Rounded Hex Shaft to 7/8in.
Follow the
MAXPlanetary Build Guide
to assemble a single stage MAXPlanetary gearbox then attach it to using two #10-32 x 1/2in Socket Head Screws and a 5/32in Allen Key.
In order to use a MAXPlantary in a 1:1 configuration it will require cutting the shaft of the NEO 1.1 or CIM motor. Using a Dremel tool or other abrasive grinder is the recommended method.
