This section outlines the steps required to build the REV Class Bot V2. This design is a good starting point for robot design using the REV 15mm Build System. However, modification may be required to address the specific needs of the challenge being met.
The assembly of this robot is broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each section begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of required materials for all sections is listed below.
