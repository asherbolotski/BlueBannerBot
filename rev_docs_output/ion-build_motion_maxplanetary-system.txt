MAXPlanetary System Overview
The MAXPlanetary System (
REV-21-2100
) is a cartridge-based modular planetary gearbox designed from the ground up for NEO-class motors. The design of the MAXPlanetary has been carefully optimized to provide torque density unavailable in FRC up until now.
The MAXPlanetary is intended for use with the NEO, NEO 550, Falcon 500, and 775 motors. Building on the ability to iterate and adjust designs easily, the MAXPlanetary System consists of lubricated cartridges allowing for swapping gear ratios on the fly and with ease. Users can configure a single-stage planetary using one of three different reduction cartridges or build multi-stage gearboxes by stacking individual cartridges together. The user can use the included 1/2in hex shaft or use a custom length of hex shaft best suited for the application. The gearbox also provides two mounting options, face mount and side mount, for ultimate flexibility in your robot design.

MAX 90 Degree Gearbox
Designed with an efficient right-angle configuration, the MAX 90 Degree Gearbox offers a robust and high-performance solution to building a more compact robot. Connect the MAX 90 Degree Gearbox to the MAXPlanetary System in a 90-degree orientation for maximum flexibility and ease of use in tight spaces. The through bore design of the gearbox allows for easy mounting and integration into a wide range of applications. Its 90-degree output orientation provides a compact and efficient way to transmit power and torque at right-angle configurations.

MAX 90 Degree Gearbox Features
The REV Robotics MAXPlanetary Gearbox includes the following features:
Three different, self-contained gear ratio cartridges providing twenty-seven gear ratios ranging from 3:1 to 125:1
High torque density
Easy assembly without modifying the motor
A Socket 1/2in Hex Output with the ability to retain a shaft blind
Assembled front to back for ease of changing the gear ratio while the MAXPlanetary Gearbox is mounted on the robot
When assembling the MAX 90 Degree Gearbox we recommend adding grease during assembly and re-applying as needed for the maintenance of your mechanism. For most applications, using
White Lithium Grease
or
Red Tacky Grease
will provide sufficient lubrication.
Cartridge Features
A breakdown of the MAXPlanetary Cartridges
Input Spline
- Accepts torque from the previous stage while being easy to insert and remove.
Output Spline
- Provides torque transfer between one stage and the next while being easy to insert and remove.
Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together pass through these holes.
Shields
- Keeps the internal components of the gear stage in their place when the stage isnâ€™t assembled into a gearbox.  Also retains grease to keep the gear stage lubricated throughout its service life.
Alignment Tabs
- Alignment features that engage with the alignment notches on the previous stage.  The directional nature of the alignment features prevent the user from assembling any gearbox components backwards.
Alignment Notches
- Provides a socket for the alignment tabs to engage with.  These features keep the rotating components concentric as well as providing angular alignment to keep the flat faces of the gearbox in plane.
Input Features
Side Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted on top of structural components without obstructing the front of the gearbox.
Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together pass through these holes.
Alignment Notches
- Provides a socket for the alignment tabs on the first gear stage to engage with.  These features keep the rotating components concentric as well as providing angular alignment to keep the flat faces of the gearbox in plane.
NEO Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting NEO-class motors to the input block.
550 Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting the NEO 550 to the gearbox.
775 Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting 775-series motors to the gearbox
775 Vent Holes
- These holes line up with the vent holes on the face of 775-series motors and allow cooling air to pass through the motor.
Output Features
Socket 1/2in Hex Output
- Engages with a 1/2in hex shaft to drive a robot mechanism. The output includes a #10 clearance hole through the middle which allows a shaft to be retained in the output.
Face Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted to the face of a bracket or tube in several useful orientations.
Side Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted on top of structural components without obstructing the front of the gearbox.
Threaded Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together thread into these holes to clamp the gearbox stack together.
Input Spline
- Accepts torque from the last gear stage while being easy to insert and remove.
Alignment Tabs
- Alignment features that engage with the alignment notches on the last stage. The directional nature of the alignment features prevent the user from assembling any gearbox components backwards.
