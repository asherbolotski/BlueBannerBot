Locating ElapsedTime Blocks:
Before getting started, let's quickly identify where we will find our ElapsedTime blocks. This menu can be found under the Utilities dropdown on our side toolbar.
Setting up the Basics:
For this section, let's start by creating a new OpMode named HelloRobot_ElapsedTime using the BasicOpMode sample.
Recall when we
created variables while programming our drivetrain
. We will be using them again during this part to help with calculations! To start create a variable called
runtime
.
From the variable menu, add the
block to the OpMode below the
comment block.
In order to utilize elements of the ElapsedTime, runtime will act as the
ElapsedTime
variable.  Add the
block to the
block.
Before moving on to the rest of the ElapsedTime structure lets go ahead and add the motor related blocks. Add
to the op mode to the while loop.
Remember that on a drivetrain one of our motors will need to be set to run in reverse to prevent the robot from spinning in place! Add the
block under the the
block set.
