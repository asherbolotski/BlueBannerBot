public class
MovingAverageFilterSim
extends
Object
Simulate a moving average filter where samples are normally at some fixed rate that is different
 than the rate provided by the simulation.
A sum of sample deltas is stored until the cumulative sample delta is greater than or equal to
 the sample rate. Two cases are possible:
1) The cumulative delta between samples is *greater or equal* to the sample rate. In this
 case, take a simple linear interpolation between the sample before and after the sample time, and
 add this new sample to the moving average.
2) The cumulative delta between the samples is *less* than the sample rate. In this case,
 store the last value, and accumulate the delta time.
