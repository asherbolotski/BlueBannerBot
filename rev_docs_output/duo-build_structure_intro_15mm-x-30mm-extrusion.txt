15mm x 30mm Extrusion Basics
The 15mm x 30mm profile of the
Extrusion
has slots on on all four sides that accept standard
M3 hardware
. Rather than using a T-nut, which is more expensive,  slide a M3 hex head screw along the slot and adjust brackets and other build materials as needed. As illustrated in the image above, the ends of the Extrusion also have a 5mm hole
pitch
that can be M3 tappped. The 15mm x 30mm Extrusion has one slot on each 15mm face and 3 slots on each 30mm face, allowing for some additional design flexibility when compared to the standard 15mm extrusion.
To learn more about extrusion systems versus pitch systems return to the
Structure Page
.
Product Specs
Material: 6063 Aluminum, clear or black anodized
Height: 15mm
Width: 30mm
Length:
1m
or
420mm
Extrusion can be cut to shorter lengths as needed
When to Use?
The 15mm x 30mm Extrusion is great for areas where more torsional strength is needed in an application than the standard 15mm Extrusion.
Torsional Strength
is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand a twisting load.
To learn more about why torsional strength is helpful to your robot design visit the
constraining motion
page
How to Use?
The point of the extrusion system is to offer more flexibility in design than would come in a fixed pitch system. The slots in the extrusion allow brackets and other components to be slid along the 15mm Extrusion to an infinite number of positions.
