Reinforcement Steps
Preparing the wheel
Identify the pockets in the core that align with the lower ridges in the tread, this is where we will be placing the rivets
Drill 6 holes in the tread that line up with the pockets of the core using a #9 drill bit. These holes should be slightly off-center towards the direction of the side of the wheel that the pockets are on. Use the image below as a guide for the placement of these holes.
Once all 6 of your holes have been drilled, place 6 rivets in the wheel. Be sure to compress the tread while you are putting the rivets in so that they will not get caught on the field carpet.
