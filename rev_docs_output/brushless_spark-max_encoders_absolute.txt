Encoder Output Voltage Level
5.0V
Encoder Type Supported
Duty Cycle or PWM
Absolute encoder input is supported by SPARK MAX Firmware Version 1.6.0 and newer,
Connecting an Absolute Encoder
Connecting an absolute encoder that is not a Through Bore Encoder will likely require a custom wiring harness or
SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board
to connect the necessary encoder power, ground, and signals to the SPARK MAX Data Port. When using an Absolute Encoder use the following pinout information for the Data Port:
