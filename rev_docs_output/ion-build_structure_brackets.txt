Brackets are used to join different parts of the robot together. Most brackets can be divided into two categories:
Motion
and
Structure
. Motion brackets help create strong attachment points for your motion components and any parts of your robot that move. Structure brackets are designed to hold pieces of extrusion together.
Bracket Basics
In the REV ION Build System, there are two major groupings of brackets:
MAXSpline
and
construction
. The major distinguishing feature of MAXSpline brackets is a MAXSpline bore or MAX Pattern to support bearings and
MAXHubs
.
Construction brackets are essentially any bracket in the REV ION Build System that does not have a MAXSpline bore. Because the term construction bracket encompasses a broad range of REV ION products, it can be further subdivided as structural brackets and actuator brackets.
Structural brackets act as connectors between structural components. For example, these are the type of brackets you will want to use when connecting
MAXTube
and Extrusion elements. Actuator brackets on the other hand are intended to mount and support motors and servos.
