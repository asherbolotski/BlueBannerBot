The SPARK MAX can be controlled by three different interfaces, servo-style PWM, controller area network (CAN), and USB. The following sections describe the physical connections to these interfaces in detail. For details on the operation and protocols of the PWM, CAN, and USB interfaces, please see the
section on Control Interfaces
.
CAN/PWM Port
The CAN/PWM Port is located on the power input side of the SPARK MAX. This port can be connected to either a servo-style PWM signal or a CAN bus with other devices. Connector details can be found below.

Identical-function pins are electrically connected inside the SPARK MAX, therefore the CAN daisy-chain is completed internally and any two signal and ground pairs can be used for PWM.
USB-C Port
The USB-C Port is located on the power input side of the SPARK MAX. It supports USB 2.0 and 5V power for the SPARK MAX's internal microcontroller. While you can configure the SPARK MAX without main power, you will not be able to spin a motor.
