SPARK Flex Data Port Break Out Cable
The
SPARK Flex Data Port Breakout Cable (REV-11-2853)
breaks out the default pin functions of the SPARK Flex Data Port into commonly used connectors for external sensors.
The keyed and locking Data Port connector ensures a secure and aligned fit when plugged into the SPARK Flex Motor Controller. Its JST-PH 6-pin connector is designed to plug directly into the REV Through Bore Encoder, connecting both the quadrature and absolute encoder outputs to the appropriate SPARK Flex Data Port pins. Additional inputs, like Limit Switch and Analog inputs, are broken out to shrouded, 1 x 3 pinned, 0.1in pitch, PWM-style connectors that provide both power and ground in addition to the input signal.
SPARK Flex Data Port Pigtail Cable
The
SPARK Flex Data Port Pigtail Cable (REV-11-2852)
breaks out the SPARK Flex Data Port to individual unterminated wires and is useful for connecting custom circuits or sensors without a standard connector. It features the keyed and locking Data Port connector to ensure a secure and aligned fit when plugged into the SPARK Flex Motor Controller. Each wire is uniquely color-coded for easy identification.
Data Port Connector Information
The SPARK Flex Data Port is a 0.05 in pitch, 2 x 5 pin, keyed and locking connector. Custom cables can be made with the following parts:
