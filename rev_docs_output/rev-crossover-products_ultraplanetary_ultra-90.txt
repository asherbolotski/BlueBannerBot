The Ultra 90 Degree Gearbox allows you to connect the UltraPlanetary Gearbox and the HD Hex Motor in a 90-degree orientation for maximum flexibility and ease of use in tight spaces. This versatile gearbox can also be used to transfer power between two 5mm hex shafts that are at a right-angle configuration.

Mounting holes compatible with the REV Motion Pattern
Affix between pieces of channel in a channel drivetrain for a more compact design
Through-bore hex on the output allows positioning the gearbox in the middle of a shaft or using a very long shaft without needing to cut it
Blind socket hex input allows shafts of varying length and also captures the shaft when mounted to the output of an UltraPlanetary Gearbox
Ball bearings located on the input and output for a smooth performance
