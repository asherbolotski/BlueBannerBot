The SPARK Flex is a motor controller with many features allowing it to control a host of brushless and brushed motor controllers. Out of the box, the Flex can be docked directly with a NEO Vortex Brushless Motor and drive it with the Flex's PWM interface. This Getting Started guide will assume that you are driving NEO Vortex and includes steps to get the motor spinning using the REV Hardware Client as well as information on how to configure your SPARK Flex.

Driving other motors requires the SPARK Flex Dock (coming soon) and will be covered in its own separate guides.
Before You Start
Before following this guide, the REV Hardware Client should be installed before continuing. It is the best way to verify that the device up to date and configured correctly. Configuration through the Hardware Client is
required
before using the CAN interface.
