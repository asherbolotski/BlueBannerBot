Connecting Via USB
Steps
Power on the Control Hub, by plugging the 12V Slim Battery (
REV-31-1302
) into the XT30 connector labeled “BATTERY” on the Control Hub.
The Control Hub is ready to connect with a PC when the LED turns green. Note: the light blinks blue every ~5 seconds to indicate that the Control Hub is healthy.
Plug the Control Hub into the PC using a USB-A to USB-C Cable (
REV-11-1232
)
Startup the REV Hardware Client. Once the Hub is fully connected it will show up on the front page of the UI under the Hardware Tab. Select the Control Hub.
