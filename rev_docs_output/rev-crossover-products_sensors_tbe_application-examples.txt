The REV Through Bore Encoder uses the Broadcom AEAT-8800-Q24 magnetic rotary sensor to measure the rotation of a magnet embedded and geared to the through bore shaft hole. The AEAT-8800-Q24 uses hall effect technology to measure changes in the magnetic field as the shaft and magnet rotates.
A major benefit of the REV Through Bore Encoder is the flexibility of measuring any shaft in your system. Directly measuring the rotation of an output shaft allow users to read encoders without having to calculate gear ratios.

Wiring Examples
The Through Bore Encoder comes with several different cables making it easier to connect to different devices. Below are a few wiring examples for the more commonly used devices with the Through Bore Encoder.
Control Hub (REV-31-1595)
To connect the Through Bore Encoder to a Control Hub, use the included JST PH 6-pin to JST PH 4-pin cable. The Through Bore Encoder plugs into the Encoder ports on the Control Hub.
SPARK MAX (REV-11-2158)
Wiring of the Through Bore Encoder to a SPARK MAX changes depending on the motor type being used with the SPARK MAX. Both motor types use the included JST PH 6-pin cable.
Brushed Motors
When using a brushed motor with SPARK MAX, the Through Bore Encoder is connected directly to the Encoder Port on the front of the SPARK MAX.
Brushless Motors
When using a brushless motor with SPARK MAX, the Through Bore Encoder is used as an Alternate Encoder. Using the Alternate Encoder Adapter (REV-11-1881) with the SPARK MAX allows for the JST PH 6-pin cable to connect directly to the adapter and the Through Bore Encoder.
Make sure to check the
Alternate Encoder Mode bring up in the SPARK MAX documentation
before connecting the Through Bore Encoder.
NI roboRIO
NI's roboRIO supports both quadrature and duty cycle encoders. There are slight differences in wiring depending on what mode is desired. Both wiring setups use the included JST PH 6-pin to 4 Channel PWM Cable.
Quadrature Encoder (Relative)
When using the Through Bore Encoder as a quadrature encoder, plug the ENC A (blue) and ENC B (yellow) signal lines into the DIO ports on the roboRIO.
Duty Cycle Encoder (Absolute)
When using the Through Bore Encoder as a duty cycle encoder plug the ABS (white) signal line into a DIO port on the roboRIO.
Shaft Options
1/2” Hex
This is the default shaft configuration that comes with the encoder out of the box.
3/8” Hex
When using the 3/8” Hex insert, press the insert into the 1/2” Hex hole.
If you are having difficulty pressing the insert into the encoder, try flipping the insert over and press it in. There is a slight taper in the insert, so it is recommended to press the insert with the smaller end first. When removing, it is recommended to push the insert out in the reverse order (larger end first).
5mm Hex
When using the 5mm Hex insert, press the insert into the 1/2” Hex hole.
If you are having difficulty pressing the insert into the encoder, try flipping the insert over and press it in. There is a slight taper in the insert, so it is recommended to press the insert with the smaller end first. When removing, it is recommended to push the insert out in the reverse order (larger end first).
1/4" Round
When using the 1/4” round insert, press the insert onto the shaft first and then place the encoder onto the insert.
This adapter fits the encoder shaft on common gearboxes like the Toughbox Mini, which is traditionally included in the FRC Kit of Parts Chassis.
Switch Options
There is a switch on the side of the encoder and with two options: ‘A’ and ‘S’. ‘A’ is the ABI encoder output mode which outputs the incremental and absolute encoder signals. ‘S’ is the SSI/SPI mode used in the manufacturing stage and potential future features. Currently, only the ‘A’ mode is supported. Make sure that the switch is in the ‘A’ position when using this encoder.
AM14U KOP Chassis – Encoder Install
The REV Through Bore Encoder is specifically designed with the end user in mind, allowing teams to place sensors in the locations closest to the rotation that they wish to measure. Using the ¼” round insert allows teams to easily attach the Through Bore Encoder to the output shaft of the ToughBox Mini with the AM14U series kit of parts chassis. This guide is to show the process for attaching the Through Bore Encoder to the ToughBox Mini gearbox
