The REV Robotics UltraPlanetary System includes the following features:
Three different gear ratio cartridges providing twenty-seven gear ratios ranging nominally from 3:1 to 125:1.
Pre-assembled cartridges for superior performance and ease of use.
Flexible output allowing for the designer to choose shaft length or mounting driven parts directly to the output stage.
Cartridge Features
The REV Robotics UltraPlanetary Cartridges are nominally 10mm thick and made of a plastic (reinforced nylon) molded ring gear with hardened steel planet and sun gears. Cartridges are pre-assembled and lubricated allowing for more time for iterating designs rather than assembling individual stages of gearbox. Check individual CAD Models for exact dimensions for each cartridge.
Alignment Ribs:
Protrusions on the input side of the cartridge to help seat stages of the system together.
Assembly Holes:
M3 assembly holes for attaching cartridges to input and output stages.
Input Gear:
Sun Gear with a sliding fit for a 13 tooth, M0.55, gear.
Output Gear:
13 tooth, M0.55, carrier gear.
Each cartridge was designed with reliability, durability, and ease of use in mind while having a variety of output ratios when used in combination. Cartridges are referred to at the gear ratio of their closest whole number. For exact gear ratios of individual stages see

Output Stage Features
The REV Robotics UltraPlanetary Output Stage V2 (REV-41-1615) is nominally 17mm thick with 6mm protruding from the casing for output motion. The Output Stage is pre-assembled and made of a plastic (reinforced nylon) molded body with a ball bearing carrying the load of the Female Output Gear. Check the CAD Model for exact dimensions of the Output Stage.
Alignment Ribs:
Protrusions on the input side of the output stage to help seat stages of the system together.
Assembly Holes:
M3 assembly holes for attaching the output stage to cartridge and input stages.
Input Gear:
Piece with sliding fit for a 13 tooth, M0.55, gear.
Female Output Gear:
Female 5mm hex output for custom length shafts. Motion pattern present for directly attaching sprockets, gears, structure, and wheels.
When directly attaching Motion Components to the Output Stage, remove the set screw from the 5mm Hex Output
