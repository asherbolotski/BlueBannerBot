Every device connected to the Expansion Hub (
REV-31-1153
) will need to be added to the Robot Configuration file before you can use the device in your program. The Robot Configuration will allow you to give your sensors and actuators meaningful names that you can reference while programming.
For this example, we will configure a simple two motor robot drivetrain.
Step
Image
Select the menu on either the Driver Station or Robot Controller. Then select “Configure Robot”.
Select “New” in the top left hand corner.
Select “Expansion Hub Portal 1” (embedded).
Select “Expansion Hub 1”.
Select “Motors”.
Select the Drop Down menu for “Port 0” then select the motor type attached to the port. In the case of the Minibot in Figure 4, select the “Rev Robotics Core Hex Motor”.
Press “Enter motor name here” and name the motor “left_drive”.
This is the name that you will use when you are programming your robot to control this motor. Always use descriptive names so that you can remember what a device does when you are programming.
Repeat the process for “Port 1” and name the motor “right_drive”.
Press “Done” once to go back to the list of device ports and then select I2C Bus 0.
Add the built-in REV Expansion Hub IMU. Name it “imu”
Press the “Done” button (at the top left corner of the page) 3 times.
Press “Save”.
Enter “miniBot” as your configuration name, then select “OK”.
You now have an active configuration called “miniBot”. Press the Android back button to return to the Driver Station page.
