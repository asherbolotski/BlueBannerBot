Tackling the challenges of the FIRST Robotics Competition requires rapid iteration, numerous revisions, and adaptation to the game challenges. Recognizing that not all teams have access to the same equipment or resources, we created REV ION to enable and empower all teams to be competitive.
REV ION is a system of mechanical and electrical products that are perfectly compatible with each other, allowing for complex robot designs without large budgets or extensive manufacturing resources. With basic tools, teams can build affordable, competitive machines while preserving the ability to infinitely reconfigure and iterate on their designs.
Look for the
REV ION flag and logo
on our website and shop with confidence, knowing all products are compatible and designed to work together seamlessly.
REV Robotics is proud to supply for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). For more information about the FIRST Robotics Competition, please visit the
