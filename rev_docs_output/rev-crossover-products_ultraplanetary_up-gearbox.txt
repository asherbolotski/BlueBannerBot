The REV UltraPlanetary System is a cartridge based modular gearbox designed to handle the rigors of the competition and the classroom. Users can configure a single-stage planetary using one of three different reduction cartridges, build multi-stage gearboxes through stacking individual cartridges together, and choose two different ways for transferring power through the output stage through face mounting to the stage or choosing the length of 5mm hex shaft best suited for the application.
The UltraPlanetary Gearbox Kit (
REV-41-1600
) includes an input stage and pinion gear pressed onto the REV HD Hex Motor. Building on the ability to iterate and adjust designs easily using the REV Building System, the UltraPlanetary System consists of pre-assembled and lubricated cartridges allowing for swapping gear ratios on the fly and with ease. The system also allows for the user to choose the length of 5mm shaft to fit their application or to face mount a sprocket, gear, wheel, or structure using the REV Motion Pattern on the output stage.
Using the UltraPlanetary Gearbox System with other 550 class motors, like the NEO 550 Brushless motor, requires pressing of an UltraPlanetary 550 Motor Pinion (
REV-41-1608
) onto the motor, use of the UltraPlanetary 550 Motor Plate (
REV-41-1607
), along with use of individual cartridge reductions and an UltraPlanetary Female 5mm Hex Output (
REV-41-1604
).
The UltraPlanetary has a variety of options for mounting with four different brackets available for mounting to REV Extrusion, REV C Channel, or REV U Channel.
