This version of the Class Bot uses parts that are not included in the current version of the
EDU Kit
(REV-45-2041)
.
Please be sure to check the
Bill of Materials
to see the complete list of necessary parts.
This section outlines the steps required to build the REV Class Bot using parts from the REV EDU Kit (REV-45-1517). This design is a good starting point for robot design using the REV 15mm Build System. However, modification may be required to address the specific needs of the challenge.
The assembly of this robot is broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each section begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of required materials for all sections is listed below.
