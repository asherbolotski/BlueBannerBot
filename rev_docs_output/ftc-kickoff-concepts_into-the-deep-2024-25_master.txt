We are excited for the 2024-2025 FTC Game, INTO THE DEEP℠ presented by RTX and reveal our Starter Bot! Utilizing just the
FTC Starter Kit V3.1
and the
DUO Control Bundle
, this starter bot is the culmination of analyzing the game, prototyping, and technical documentation. The REV DUO FTC Starter Bot is designed to give teams a starting point for building their robot, while leaving room for iteration, revision, and adaptation to the game’s challenges.
We're looking forward to see what teams create this year!
