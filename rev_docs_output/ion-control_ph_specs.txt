Due to the input current requirements for the Pneumatic Hub, it is recommended to use the maximum wire gauge possible for the Main Power Input.
Make sure to consider the current and safety requirements when choosing a wire gauge for any given application.

It is recommended to use a 20A fuse or circuit breaker with the Pneumatic Hub if using a compressor with higher peak current draw, such as the CP26 or the Thomas 405ADC38.
Double check the specifications of your desired compressor before connecting it to the Pneumatic Hub. Compressors that have an inrush current higher than the compressor switch MOSFET can handle will damage the Pneumatic Hub on start up.
The Pneumatic Hub is not compatible with the 215 series of Thomas compressors.

The Pneumatic Hub assumes a REV Analog Pressure Sensor (REV-11-1107) is connected by default.
†
The REV Analog Pressure Sensor minimum output voltage is 0.5V. A measurement of 0V triggers a fail safe condition that assumes the sensor has been disconnected.
