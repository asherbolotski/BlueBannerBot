Dead Axle Tube - 3/4in
Dead Axle Tube
(REV-21-2510)
is compatible with the REV ION System and can be used with 3/4in Needle Bearing Carrier
(REV-21-2385)
and MAXSpline Shaft
(REV-21-2520)
as the dead axle in a dead axle roller. Can also be used with custom rollers and as structural support.
What is a Dead Axle?
A
Live Axle
is an axle that transmits torque to a wheel. This can be done through a 1/2in hex hub, gear, pulley, or sprocket. In a live axle assembly, the axle will rotate along with the wheel. Live axles are commonly used in drivetrains or as a flywheel.
In comparison, a
Dead Axle
is an axle that only supports the wheels and does not move. Generally, bearings are used to support the wheel on the dead axle so it can spin freely. Dead axles remain stationary while the supported wheel is in motion. Some applications include free-spinning intake rollers and non-powered drivetrain wheels.
Example of a wheel using a live vs. dead axle
Application Example
3/4in Dead Axle Tube
(REV-21-2510)
acts as the structural member in this MAXSpline Shaft
(REV-21-2520)
dead axle application. Supporting the Dead Axle Tube is a Needle Bearing
(REV-21-2386)
(3/4in ID, 1in OD) that fits into MAXSpline Shaft. Tube nuts
(REV-21-2382-PK10
) for the 5/8in ID of the Dead Axle Tube makes mounting your assembly easy. Alternatively you could use a Stepped Bushing
(REV-21-2396)
to mount your MAXSpline Shaft to your Dead Axle Tube.
Check out our
Example Linear Actuator Arm featuring MAXSpline Shaft Dead Axle
for an Onshape example.
Bushing
This Stepped Bushing (
REV-21-2396
) in conjunction with the MAXSpline Shaft and the 3/4in tube can be used to build robust and effective rollers and intakes for your FRC robot. It can also be used as a pivot point when combined with a MAXTube and 3/4in dead axle.
Endcaps
This MAXSpline Shaft Endcap (
REV-21-2393-PK2
) enables you to convert MAXSpline Shaft into a live axle driven by a 1/2in Hex shaft.
