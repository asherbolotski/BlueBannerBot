Gearboxes are a very common way to transform motion in FIRST Robotics Competition. They are generally compact and modular, able to be mounted on your robot wherever theyâ€™re needed. Some have fixed gear ratios, and some can be easily changed for the needed application.
A popular style of gearbox is the adjustable, modular, planetary gearbox. In this kind of planetary gearbox, cartridges of different gear ratios are stacked to create an overall reduction. This is a fantastic option for teams to prototype with because they can quickly change the gear ratio without needing to redesign the entire mechanism.
2 Motor Drivetrain Gearbox Through Bore
The 2 Motor Drivetrain Gearbox Through Bore (
REV-21-2190
) is compatible with the REV ION System and can be mounted in a variety of ways, including flush with tube or spaced to enable both chain in tube and chain/belt outside tube designs. Standard pre-formed mounts for a Through Bore Encoder
(REV-11-1271)
ensure the gearbox is on the same horizontal plane to help keep alignment frustrations to a minimum.
2 Motor Gearbox - Through Bore
The 2 Motor Gearbox (
REV-21-2099
) Through Bore is compatible with the REV ION System. This two motor into one output gearbox allows the user to adjust the gear ratio by changing pinion and cluster gear (12:60, 18:54, 24:48, or 36:36). The output shaft is 1/2in Hex through bore, and output gears have a MAXSpline for compatibility.
MAXPlanetary System
The NEO Motor matches the design flexibility of other REV ION products with our optional MAXPlanetary Gearbox (
REV-21-2100
) The MAXPlanetary is primarily intended to be used with the NEO, NEO 550, Falcon 500, and 775 motors. For those utilizing a swerve drive in their build, the NEO Motor is also available with a straight shaft i.e. no gearbox.

UltraPlanetary System (NEO 550)
The NEO 550 Motor
(REV-21-1651)
matches the design flexibility of other REV ION products with our optional UltraPlanetary Gearbox (
REV-41-1600
). This UltraPlanetary System is a cartridge-based modular gearbox designed to handle the rigors of the competition and the classroom. Building on the ability to iterate and adjust designs easily using the REV Building System, the UltraPlanetary System consists of pre-assembled and lubricated cartridges allowing for swapping gear ratios on the fly and with ease.
