The REV Through Bore Encoder is designed with the end user in mind, allowing teams to place sensors in the locations closest to the rotation they wish to measure. This rotary sensor measures both relative and absolute position through its ABI quadrature output and its absolute position pulse output.
Features
Incremental and absolute magnetic encoder
Built-in magnet
Quadrature output - A, B, and Index
Absolute output - Pulse Width (Duty Cycle)
Broadcom AEAT-8800
Factory-calibrated zero-position
Zero calibrated to notch in case
Through-bore design
Easily mounted to any shaft
Bore inserts
1/2" Hex (default)
3/8" Hex
5mm Hex
1/4" Round
Mounting holes
Hole spacing matches common FRC gearboxes and chassis
The FTC Control System currently only supports Incremental Encoder input through the motor encoder ports. Absolute pulse input is not supported.
Do not disassemble the sensor.
Disassembling the Through Bore Encoder will dereference the zero position with the physical case notch. It is not possible to recalibrate the zero position as it is permanently saved inside the sensor at the factory
