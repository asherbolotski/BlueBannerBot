Part 2: Robot Control
the idea of creating a limit switch was introduced using a physical sensor, like a touch sensor. We can make use of our motor's built-in encoder to do something similar. While a physical sensor would be described as a hard limit, using the built-in encoder is called a soft limit.
To set the soft limits we will build off the program created in the last sections (HelloRobot_ArmEncoder)!
HelloRobot_ArmEncoder program
Creating minPosition and maxPosition
To start, we need to create our upper and lower limits. Create two new variables one called
minPosition
and one called
maxPosition
to be added to initialization.
maxPosition and minPosition added for our limits
For now we want the
minPosition
set as our starting position and the
maxPosition
set to our 90 degree position. Set
minPosition
equal to
and set
maxPosition
equal to
.  The
block previously used for
armPosition
can be moved to our
maxPosition
.
Adjusting our If/Else Statement
To start, our If/Else Statement will be changed back to a simplified format like we had at the beginning of
estimating the position of the arm
.
If/Else Statement for arm movement
To set the limit we need to edit our
if/else
statement to include our limits:
If
up on the Dpad is pressed and the position of the arm is less than the
maxPosition
, then the arm will move to the
maxPosition
.
If
down on the Dpad is pressed and the position of the arm is greater than the
minPosition
then the arm will move towards the
minPosition
.
Use the "logic" dropdown to fill out the statement's check
Overriding Limits
One of the benefits of having a soft limit is being able to exceed that limit.
Remember that the encoders zero tick position is determined by the position of the arm when the Control Hub powers on! So if we aren't careful to reset the arm before powering on our robot this will effect the arm's range of motion. For instance, if we have to reset the Control Hub while the arm is in the 90 degree position, the 90 degree position will become equal to 0 encoder ticks.
As a back up, we can create an override for the range of motion. There are a few different ways an override can be created, but in our case we are going to use the "A" button and touch sensor to help reset our range.
Adding a Gamepad Override
Start by editing the
to add another
condition. Use the
block as the condition. Add a
block to the do portion of the
block and set the power to -0.5.
Adding gamepad "A" override
Now that we have this change in place, when the "A" button is pressed the arm will move toward the starting position.
Adding a Touch Sensor Limit
Next, when the arm reaches and presses the touch sensor we want to
STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER
.
We can create an additional
statement that focuses on performing this stop and reset when the touch sensor is pressed. Check out
Programming Touch Sensors
from Part 1: Tackling the Basics for review if needed!
