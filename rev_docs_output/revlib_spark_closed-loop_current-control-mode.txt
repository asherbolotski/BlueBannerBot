Current Control uses a PID controller to run the motor at a consistent current providing a consistent torque. The PID controller is run using the setpoint, in Amps, and the internally measured current draw.
It is called as shown below:
Java
C++
Copy
m_controller
.
setReference
(setPoint
,
ControlType
.
kCurrent
);
API Docs:
setReference
Copy
using
namespace
rev
::
spark;
m_controller.SetReference(setPoint, SparkBase::ControlType::kCurrent);
API Reference:
SetReference
Current Control mode will turn your mechanism continuously and will speed up to maximum velocity if unloaded. Use caution when running this mode and avoid using it on mechanisms with a limited range of motion.
