Final Assembly Steps
Slide the four Pre-Loaded brackets onto the Drive Rail Assembly as shown.
Align the Pre-Loaded Brackets where 6 Hex Cap Screws and Nylock Nuts are exposed.
Add two Pre-Loaded Brackets to the Motor side C Channel.
Have the edge of the bracket roughly at the center of the large (9mm) hole. Start with the fifth hole to the left of the 90mm Single Sprocket Assembly.
Tighten the Nyloc Nuts until they are snug
Slide the 45mm X 15m C Channel - 248MM onto the Preloaded Brackets as shown.
Tighten the Nyloc Nuts until they are snug.
Repeat sliding four Pre-Loaded brackets onto the other Drive Rail Assembly as shown.
Repeat aligning the Pre-Loaded Brackets where 6 Hex Cap Screws and Nylock Nuts are exposed.
Repeat adding Pre-Loaded Brackets to the Motor side C Channel.
Have the edge of the bracket roughly at the center of the large (9mm) hole. Start with the fifth hole to the left of the Double Sprocket Assembly.
Tighten the Nyloc Nuts until they are snug
Slide the second Drive Rail on.
Once in place, tighten the Nyloc Nuts until they are snug.
Slide two pieces of 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Brackets until they are through both sets brackets. One 15mm Extrusion is for the top and the other for the bottom.
Align the 15mm Extrusion – 420mm so approximately the same amount of Extrusion is left on the end of each Bracket.
Tighten the Nyloc Nuts until they are snug.
Add a Through Bore Bearing – Short to both of the Drive Shafts and Through Bore Bearing – Long to the remaining shafts.
Note:
the longer section on the bearing faces away from the Channel
Take the Mecanum wheels and place on the shafts as shown.
Note:
See the steps below to see how to place the left and right Mecanum Wheels.
Each Mecanum Wheel Set comes with two right (REV-41-1656) and two left (REV-41-1657) mecanum wheels. This is determined by the direction of the leading edge of the rollers. If the rollers point left it is a left wheel and if they point right it is a right wheel.
Each side of the chassis needs one left and one right wheel. Place the wheels as shown.
See the
Mecanum Wheel Setup and Behavior
Section for more information.
Add one shaft collar to the end of each shaft.
Tighten down the shaft collars on each wheel to secure them in place.
