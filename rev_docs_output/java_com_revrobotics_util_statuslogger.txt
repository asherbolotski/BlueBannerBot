Method Details
start
public static
void
start
()
Manually start capturing data from REV devices to a REV binary log (.revlog).
Note:
This method provides an explicit override for the default logging behavior. In
 most cases, this is not required, as logging begins automatically on the first call to any
 REVLib function.
Use this method only for advanced cases where logging must begin at a precise moment, such
 as before the main robot loop or other subsystems are initialized.

disableAutoLogging()
stop
public static
void
stop
()
Stops the data logging session.
While stopped, no new data from REV devices will be written to the REV binary log (.revlog).
 The logging session is not terminated and can be resumed at any time by calling
start()
.

disableAutoLogging
public static
void
disableAutoLogging
()
Prevents the data logger from starting automatically.
IMPORTANT:
This method must be called before any other REVLib function is invoked.
 The recommended placement is as the first line in your
robotInit()
method.
After calling this, logging will not occur until it is explicitly started with
start()
. This is useful for applications that require full manual control over the logging
 lifecycle.
