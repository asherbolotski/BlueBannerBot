Converting from mm to Feet
Converting Feet to Ticks

Now that you have created the constant variables needed to calculate the amount of ticks per mm moved, you can use this to set a target distance. For instance, if you would like to have the robot move forward two feet, converting from feet to millimeters and multiplying by the
COUNTS_PER_MM
will give you the amount of counts (or ticks) needed to reach that distance!
Create two more variables called
leftTarget
and
rightTarget
.
These variables can be fluctuated and edited in your code to tell the motors what positions to go to, rather than place them with the constant variables, create these variables within the OpMode but above the
waitForStart();
command.
Copy
public
void
runOpMode()
{
leftmotor
=
hardwareMap
.
get
(
DcMotor
.
class
,
"leftmotor"
);
rightmotor
=
hardwareMap
.
get
(
DcMotor
.
class
,
"rightmotor"
);
rightmotor
.

leftmotor

rightmotor

setMode
(
DcMotor
.
RunMode
.
STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER
);
int
leftTarget;
int
rightTarget;
waitForStart()
;
The
setTargetPosition();
function takes in a integer (or
int)
data type as its parameter, rather than a double. Since both the
leftTarget
and
rightTarget
will be used to set the target position, create both variables as int variables.
Converting from mm to Feet
Right now the main distance factor is
COUNTS_PER_MM
, however you may want to go a distance that is in the imperial system, such as 2 feet (or 24 inches). The target distance in this case will need to be converted to mm.
To convert from feet to millimeters use the following formula:
d
(
m
m
)
=
d
(
f
t
)
×
304.8
d_{(mm)} = d_{(ft)} × 304.8
d
(
mm
)
​
=
d
(
f
t
)
​
×
304.8
If you convert 2 feet to millimeters, it comes out the be 609.6 millimeters. For the purpose of this guide, lets go ahead an round this to be 610 millimeters.
Converting Feet to Ticks
Next, multiply 610 millimeters by the
COUNTS_PER_MM
variable to get the number of ticks needed to move the robot 2 feet. Since the intent is to have the robot move in a straight line, set both the
leftTarget
and
rightTarget
, to be equal to 610 *
COUNTS_PER_MM
As previously mentioned the
setTargetPosition();
function requires that its parameter must be an
integer data type
. The
leftTarget
and
rightTarget
variables have been set to be integers, however the
COUNTS_PER_MM
variable is a double. Since these are two different data types, a conversion of data types needs to be done.
In this case the
COUNTS_PER_MM
needs to be converted to an integer. This is as simple as adding the line (int) in front of the double variable. However, you need to be cautious of potential rounding errors. Since
COUNTS_PER_MM
is part of an equation it is recommended that you convert to an integer AFTER the result of the equation is found.
Copy
int leftTarget = (int)(610 * COUNTS_PER_MM);
int rightTarget = (int)(610 * COUNTS_PER_MM);
Lastly, edit the
setTargetPosition();
lines so that both motors are set to the appropriate target position. To do this add the
leftTarget
and
rightTarget
variables to their respective motor:
Copy
leftmotor.setTargetPosition(leftTarget);
rightmotor.setTargetPosition(rightTarget);
