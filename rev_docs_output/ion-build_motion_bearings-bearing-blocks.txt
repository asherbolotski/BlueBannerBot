Flanged Bearing
The Flanged Bearing (
REV-21-1916
) for 1/2in Rounded Hex is compatible with the REV ION System and provides a way of locating and supporting a 1/2in Rounded Hex Shaft while it rotates. The flange on the outer space of the bearing allows the bearing to be installed in a hole or MAXSpline with no other means of retention.
Needle Bearing
The Needle Bearing
(REV-21-2386)
with 3/4in ID and 1in OD, fits into MAXSpline Shaft
(REV-21-2520)
and is used for dead axle applications. Hold it in place securely using a 3/4in Needle Bearing Carrier
(REV-21-2385)
.
Needle Bearings should be lightly greased and not run dry on shafts. We recommend
red tacky
or other Lithium based grease.

Bearing Retaining Plate
The Bearing Retaining Plate (
REV-21-2286-PK10
) is compatible with the REV ION System and is designed to securely hold bearings in place, ensuring that they remain stable and aligned during use.
Bearing Retaining Plate with bearing installed
Material:
Glass-filled nylon
Weight:
3g (0.01lb)
Compatible with MAX Pattern
Uses #10 screws or 3/16in rivets
Compatible with ION bearings or bushings
The bearing retaining plate can be aligned to sit parallel or at an angle along the MAXTube.
