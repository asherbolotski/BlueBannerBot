NEO V1.1 Overview
The REV
NEO Brushless Motor V1.1 (REV-21-1650)
is the initial update on the first brushless motor designed to meet the unique demands of the
FIRST
Robotics Competition community. NEO V1.1 offers an incredible power density due to its compact size and reduced weight, and it's designed to be a drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors, as well as an easy install with many mounting options. 

The built-in hall-effect encoder guarantees low-speed torque performance while enabling smart control without additional hardware. NEO V1.1 has been optimized to work with the
SPARK MAX Motor Controller (REV-21-2158)
to deliver incredible performance and feedback.
Features
Drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors
Shielded out-runner construction
Front and rear ball bearings
High-temperature neodymium magnets
High-flex silicone motor wires
Integrated motor sensor
3-phase hall sensors
Motor temperature sensor
New to NEO V1.1
A tapped #10-32 hole on the end of the shaft, allowing teams to retain pinions on the shaft without using external retaining rings
A tapped #10-32 hole on the back housing of the motor, making it no longer necessary to remove the motor housing to press pinions
Additional holes on the front face of the motor for added mounting flexibility
Wiring Connections
Connecting the NEO V1.1 Brushless motor is fairly straightforward. Follow the guide at
Wiring the Spark Max
, and don't forget to connect your sensor wire; the motor will not spin without it!
CAUTION: Improperly wiring the connectors can cause severe motor damage and is not covered by the warranty.
DO NOT
connect the motor directly to the battery.
