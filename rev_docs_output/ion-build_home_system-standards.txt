REV ION was created to minimize the required tools, hardware, and cost to build a robot. To accomplish this the REV ION System has standardized the following throughout its products:
#10 Clearance Holes
All hardware is #10-32 sized
Any tapped holes are #10-32
Can use 3/16in rivets
1/2 in Hole Pitch
Linear pattern or grid on structural components
Radial pattern on circular components
Some circular components also have the linear pattern for ease of attaching to structure
Combined with MAX Spline to form the MAX Pattern
1/2 in Rounded Hex Shaft
13.75mm diameter rounded corners for ease of assembly in bearings
Fits standard 1.125in OD Bearings
Fractional Axial Width
Components together along a shaft always have a total width on a fractional interval
