The
SPARK Flex (REV-11-2159)
is a new smart motor controller from REV Robotics. Its dockable form factor allows for direct mounting onto a
NEO Vortex (REV-21-1652)
, simplifying wiring while maintaining flexibility. Improving upon the foundation of the SPARK MAX, new features include 3-phase current sensing, reverse polarity protection, and an expanded Data Port with additional interfaces. When docked to an adapter, the SPARK Flex can control any existing NEO or compatible brushless/brushed DC motor.
