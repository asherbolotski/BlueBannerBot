This section outlines the steps required to build a mecanum drivetrain using the Mecanum Drivetrain Kit V2 (
REV-45-2470
). The Mecanum Drivetrain Kit V2 uses UltraPlanetary Gearboxes and Ultra 90 Degree Gearboxes for a direct drive rather than one driven with belts or chain. For instructions on how to build a mecanum drivetrain with belts and pulleys check out the
Mecanum Drivetrain Kit
or for a mecanum drivetrain with sprockets and chain see the
Channel Drivetrain - Mecanum Upgrade
.
This design is a great starting point. However, modification may be required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed.
The assembly of this drivetrain can be broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each Section Begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of all required materials for the drivetrain is listed below.
