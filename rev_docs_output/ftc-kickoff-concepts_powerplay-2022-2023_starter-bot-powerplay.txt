For the POWERPLAY season FIRST asked us at REV to help develop an introduction robot for newer teams, completely built out of the FTC Starter Kit V3 (REV-45-1883), that is able to play the game to some level of success. To design this robot we went through a similar process as we did with kickoff concepts and that works with our teams.
