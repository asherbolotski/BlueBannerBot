The REV Robotics Control Hub (
REV-31-1595
) is an affordable all in one educational robotics controller that provides the interfaces required for building robots, as well as other mechatronics, with multiple programming language options. The Control Hub was designed and built as an easy to use, dependable, and durable device for use in classroom and the competition. It features an Android operating system, built-in dual band Wi-Fi (802.11 ac/b/g/n/w), and a mature software package designed for both basic and advanced use cases. When the Control Hub software is updated with new features, the controller can receive a "field upgrade," through an update process that is fast and simple.
The Control Hub is an approved device for use in FIRST® Global and FIRST Tech Challenge.
