Now that we have an estimate for our target position let's see if we can refine it to be more precise using similar methods to what we covered during the
Drivetrain Encoders section
.
What's Needed for the Conversion
Ticks per Revolution
Recall, that ticks per revolution of the encoder shaft is different than the ticks per revolution of the shaft that is controlling a mechanism, such as what we determined on our
Drivetrain
.
For more information on the effect of motion transmission across a mechanism check out the
Compound Gearing
section.
The amount of ticks per revolution of the encoder shaft is dependent on the motor and encoder. Manufacturers of motors with built-in encoders will have information on the amount of ticks per revolution.
Visit the manufacturers website for your motor or encoders for more information on encoder counts. For HD Hex Motors or Core Hex Motors visit the
Motor
documentation.
In the
Core Hex Motor specifications
there are two different Encoder Counts per Revolution numbers:
At the motor - 4 counts/revolution
At the output - 288 counts/revolution
At the motor is the number of encoder counts on the shaft that encoder is on. This number is equivalent to the 28 counts per revolution we used for the HD Hex Motor.
The 288 counts "at the output" accounts for the change in resolution after the motion is transmitted from the motor to the built in 72:1 gearbox.
Lets use the
288 as ticks per revolution
so that we do not have to account for the gearbox in our total gear reduction variable.
Total Gear Reduction
Since we built the the gear reduction from the motor gearbox into the ticks per revolution the main focus of this section is calculating the gear reduction of the arm joint.
The motor shaft drives a 45 tooth gear that transmits motion to a 125 tooth gear. The total gear ratio is 125T:45T. To calculate the gear reduction for this gear train, we can simply divide 125 by 45.
125
45
=
2.777778
\frac{125}{45} = 2.777778
45
125
â€‹
=
2.777778
To summarize, for the Class Bot V2 the following information is true:
Ticks per revolution
288 ticks
Total gear reduction
2.777778
Adding Arm Encoders to the Program
Establishing Initialization Variables
Now that we have this information let's create two constant variables:
COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV
GEAR_REDUCTION
Add the
COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV
and
GEAR_REDUCTION
variables to the OpMode beneath where the hardware variables are created.
Copy
public class HelloRobot_ArmEncoder extends LinearOpMode {
private DcMotor arm;
static final double     COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV    = 288;
static final double     GEAR_REDUCTION    = 2.7778;
Now that these two variables have been defined, we can use them to calculate two other variables: the amount of encoder counts per rotation of the 125T driven gear and the number of counts per degree moved.
Adding Calculations to the Variables
Calculating counts per revolution of the 125T gear (or
COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV
)is the same formula used in
Converting Encoder Ticks
for our
COUNTS_PER_WHEEL_REV
variable.
So to get this variable we can multiply
COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV
by
GEAR_REDUCTION
.
Copy
static final double  COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV    = COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV * GEAR_REDUCTION;
To calculate the number of counts per degree or moved or
COUNTS_PER_DEGREE
divide the
COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV
variable by 360.
Copy
static final double     COUNTS_PER_DEGREE    = COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV/360;
Add both these variables to the OpMode:
Copy
public class HelloRobot_ArmEncoder extends LinearOpMode {
private DcMotor arm;
static final double     COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV    = 288;
static final double     GEAR_REDUCTION    = 2.7778;
static final double     COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV    = COUNTS_PER_MOTOR_REV * GEAR_REDUCTION;
static final double     COUNTS_PER_DEGREE    = COUNTS_PER_GEAR_REV/360;
Adjusting our If/Else Statement
We need to create one more non-constant variable that will act as our position. This will be called
armPosition
.
Copy
public void runOpMode() {
arm = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "arm");
int armPosition;
waitForStart();
Add this variable to the
if(gamepad1.dpad_up)
section of the
Target Position if/else
statement.
To get to the 90 degree position, the arm needs to move roughly 45 degrees, therefore set arm position equal to
COUNTS_PER_DEGREE
times 45.
Copy
while (opModeIsActive()) {
if(gamepad1.dpad_up){
armPosition = (int)(COUNTS_PER_DEGREE * 45);
arm.setTargetPosition(83);
arm.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
arm.setPower(0.4);
}
Change the target position to
armPosition
.
Copy
if(gamepad1.dpad_up){
armPosition = (int)(COUNTS_PER_DEGREE * 45);
arm.setTargetPosition(armPosition);
arm.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
arm.setPower(0.4);
}
else if (gamepad1.dpad_down){
arm.setTargetPosition(0);
arm.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
arm.setPower(0.4);
}
We could change what
armPosition
is equal to in the
gamepad1.dpad_down
portion of the
if/else if
statement such as:
Copy
else if (gamepad1.dpad_down){
armPosition = (int)(COUNTS_PER_DEGREE * 0);
arm.setTargetPosition(armPosition);
arm.setMode(DcMotorEx.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION);
arm.setPower(0.4);
}
In this case we would consistently redefine
armPosition
to match the needs of whatever positions we want to create.
Since our only two positions at the moment are our starting position and our 90 degree position it isn't necessary. However, it is a good practice to create a variable in situations like this. If we want to add another position later, we can easily edit the variable to fit our needs.
