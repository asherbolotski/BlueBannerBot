The Original SPARK Motor Controller has been discontinued and will not be re-stocked.
SPARK Overview
The SPARK Motor Controller (REV-11-1200) was a 12V 60A PWM-controlled brushed DC motor controller designed for
FIRST
Robotics Competition robots. It featured 60A continuous current with passive cooling, bi-directional limit switch inputs for smart mechanism control, an RGB LED status indicator, and a button-activated brake/coast mode.
Features
Passive cooling
No fans required
Synchronous rectification
Reduces heat generation
Limit switch inputs
Stops forward and/or reverse motion automatically
No programming required
Compatible with normally open (NO) limit switches
Calibration
Factory calibrated to 1ms – 2ms input signal
User calibratable
Integrated cable retention for PWM port
Clamping screw terminals
Better contact area and retention
RGB status LED
Detailed mode and operation feedback
