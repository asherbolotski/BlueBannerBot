This page contains a wiring diagram for the Radio Power Module with the Vivid Hosting VH-109 FRC radio, along with a few crucial notes to consider for the electrical protection of the radio.
WARNING! Be sure to avoid using both the RPM and 12VDC sources to power the VH-109 radio simultaneously, as this will result in damage to the radio.
If PoE is enabled on the VH-109 Radio, DO NOT use the RPM and a PoE camera/device simultaneously.
