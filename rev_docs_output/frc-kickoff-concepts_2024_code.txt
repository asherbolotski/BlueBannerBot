Using the Starter Bot code without a MAXSwerve Drivetrain
If you are only using part of our design on your robot, you can still use this code to help you program! To find the code for each individual mechanism, navigate to:
Copy
2024-REV-ION-FRC-Starter-Bot/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems
Then, select one of the following subsystem programs to use
ArmSubsystem.java
- raising and lowering the intake and launcher, also controls the climb
IntakeSubsystem.java
- intaking notes and feeding them to the launcher
LauncherSubsystem.java
- stopping and starting the flywheels on the launcher
In addition to referencing the subsystem code, you will need to look at
RobotContainer.java
for information about button bindings, constant/variable names, and function names. To find
RobotContainer.java
navigate to:
