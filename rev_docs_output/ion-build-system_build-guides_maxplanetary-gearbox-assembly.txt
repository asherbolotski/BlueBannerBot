The REV Robotics MAXPlanetary comes with the gearbox deconstructed allowing for the user to modify the total reduction needed for the application. Each cartridge is pre-assembled and lubricated allowing for easier customization. Below are links to steps for assembling a two-stage gearbox for specific motors.
MAXPlanetary Gearboxes purchased before 11/14/2022 will need to install the included spacer to use a CIM, miniCIM, or Falcon 500. Follow the
Spacer Installation Guide
now before proceeding to the other steps.

If you are unsure if a spacer is needed for your MAXPlanetary Gearbox, you can find more information about the changes in the
When to use a Spacer section.
