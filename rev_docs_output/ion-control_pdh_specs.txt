The following tables provide the operating and mechanical specifications for the Power Distribution Hub (PDH).
DO NOT exceed the maximum electrical specifications. Doing so will cause permanent damage to the Power Distribution Hub and will void the warranty.
The Power Distribution Hub's reverse polarity protection DOES NOT protect downstream devices. Verify the correct polarity on all power wires before operation.

Power Distribution Hub Circuit Breakers
Within the FRC community, there is a common misconception that circuit breakers are designed to trip exactly at a specified current value to protect the devices connected to your Power Distribution Hub. However, a more accurate description would be that circuit breakers are designed to trip at a specific temperature after a set amount of time to protect the electrical system from fire or other electrical hazards.
The current rating on a circuit breaker is the specification of the maximum current at which the circuit breaker is guaranteed not to trip. It is theoretically possible to see a 200% overload for greater than 1 second before it trips. Datasheets for the two most common breakers used with motors in FRC, the
40A REV Robotics ATO Auto-resetting Breakers
and the 40A Snap Action MX5 Breakers, show the 40A breakers can see 80A flow through for a short period before they trip.
