Gear Ratio Choices
The FTC Starter Kit comes with two of the UltraPlanetary Gearbox Kits with HD Hex Motors. This is an entry point into using the REV UltraPlanetary System. There are three UltraPlanetary Cartridges supporting seven different final gear reductions ranging from nominally 3:1 to 60:1. This allows for the right amount of torque for the application at hand. The motor provided already has the pinion gear pressed onto it making assembly of gearboxes easier.
When getting started with this drivetrain, it is recommended to use a nominal 20:1 Gear Ratio. This uses the UltraPlanetary 5:1 Cartridge and the UltraPlanetary 4:1 Cartridge. For more information on all gear ratio options, load ratings, and more, see the UltraPlanetary Gearbox Userâ€™s Manual on revrobotics.com.

UltraPlanetary Assembly Steps
Attach the UltraPlanetary Mounting Plate to the HD Hex Motor using two 8mm Button Head Screws.
Note:
Use the 2mm Allen Key to tighten these screws.
Seat the UltraPlanetary 5:1 Cartridge onto the input pinion.
Note:
Placing a finger on the output of the 5:1 Cartridge and turning it helps for placement.
Seat the UltraPlanetary 4:1 Cartridge onto the UltraPlanetary 5:1 Cartridge.
Note:
Placing a finger on the output of the 4:1 Cartridge and turning it helps for placement.
Seat the UltraPlanetary Output Stage onto the UltraPlanetary 4:1 Cartridge.
Note:
Placing a finger on the output of the Output Cartridge and turning it helps for placement.
Insert six of the 30mm Cap Head Screws into the holes in the outer ring off the Output Cartridge.
Tighten these screws down until they are snug not tight using a 2.5mm allen wrench.
Note:
The 30mm length is the 2nd longest screw provided with the UltraPlanetary Gearbox Kit.
Remove the set screw from the UltraPlanetary Output before attaching the Outside Mounting Plate.
Align the UltraPlanetary Outside Mounting Bracket with the mounting holes on the Output Cartridge.
Insert six 8mm Hex Cap Screws into the mounting holes.
Tighten the screws until they are snug.
