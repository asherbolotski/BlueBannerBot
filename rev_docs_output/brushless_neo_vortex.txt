NEO Vortex Overview
The
NEO Vortex Brushless Motor (REV-21-1652)
is a high-power, high-performance, and high-resolution sensored brushless motor from REV Robotics. It features a dockable controller interface that can be mounted directly to the
SPARK Flex Motor Controller (REV-11-2159)
or a
NEO Vortex Solo Adapter (REV-11-2828)
allowing control from any brushless motor controller, like the SPARK MAX. Its through-bore rotor is the heart of its unique interchangeable shaft system, facilitating easy integration with various robot mechanisms.
Features
High-resolution encoder
Integrated motor parameter and calibration memory
Through-hex bore with taper for numerous quick-change shafts
No motor wires - reliable and robust docking connections for motor phases and sensor
Dual sensor, direct contact winding temperature sensing
560KV (RPM per volt)
640 Watts (375 @ 40A)
#10-32 threaded holes on a 2in bolt circle
The motor and motor controller's silhouette fits behind a standard 2in rectangular tube
1/2in hex through-bore rotor compatible with any length hex shaft or application-specific Vortex Shafts:
8mm keyed
Falcon compatible spline
MAXSwerve with integrated key
7-tooth 20DP gear
MAXPlanetary input
Others to be announced
