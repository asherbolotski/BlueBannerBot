Smart Velocity is deprecated as of the 2025 release of REVLib, and teams using it should migrate to MAXMotion Velocity Control Mode
The Smart Velocity control mode utilizes the
Smart Motion parameters
to improve upon velocity control. Honoring the maximum acceleration, Smart Velocity will speed up and slow down your flywheel or rotary mechanism in a controlled way, reducing power draw and increasing consistency.
It is called as seen below:
Java
C++
Copy
m_controller
.
setReference
(setPoint
,
ControlType
.
kSmartVelocity
);
API Docs:
setReference
Copy
using
namespace
rev
::
spark;
m_controller.SetReference(setPoint, SparkBase::ControlType::kSmartVelocity);
API Reference:
SetReference
Smart Velocity Control mode will turn your motor continuously. Be sure your mechanism does not have any hard limits for rotation.
This graph was generated with a very slow acceleration to better show the motion, the wobbles at low speed can be minimized by increasing your acceleration.
