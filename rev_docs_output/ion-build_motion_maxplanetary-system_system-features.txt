The REV Robotics MAXPlanetary System includes the following features:
Three different, self-contained gear ratio cartridges providing twenty-seven gear ratios ranging from 3:1 to 125:1
High torque density
Easy assembly without modifying the motor
A Socket 1/2in Hex Output with the ability to retain a shaft blind
Assembled front to back for ease of changing the gear ratio while the MAXPlanetary Gearbox is mounted on the robot
Cartridge Features
A breakdown of the MAXPlanetary Cartridges
Input Spline
- Accepts torque from the previous stage while being easy to insert and remove.
Output Spline
- Provides torque transfer between one stage and the next while being easy to insert and remove.
Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together pass through these holes.
Shields
- Keeps the internal components of the gear stage in their place when the stage isnâ€™t assembled into a gearbox.  Also retains grease to keep the gear stage lubricated throughout its service life.
Alignment Tabs
- Alignment features that engage with the alignment notches on the previous stage.  The directional nature of the alignment features prevent the user from assembling any gearbox components backwards.
Alignment Notches
- Provides a socket for the alignment tabs to engage with.  These features keep the rotating components concentric as well as providing angular alignment to keep the flat faces of the gearbox in plane.
Input Features
Side Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted on top of structural components without obstructing the front of the gearbox.
Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together pass through these holes.
Alignment Notches
- Provides a socket for the alignment tabs on the first gear stage to engage with.  These features keep the rotating components concentric as well as providing angular alignment to keep the flat faces of the gearbox in plane.
NEO Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting NEO-class motors to the input block.
550 Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting the NEO 550 to the gearbox.
775 Mounting Holes
- These holes are for mounting 775-series motors to the gearbox
775 Vent Holes
- These holes line up with the vent holes on the face of 775-series motors and allow cooling air to pass through the motor.
Output Features
Socket 1/2in Hex Output
- Engages with a 1/2in hex shaft to drive a robot mechanism. The output includes a #10 clearance hole through the middle which allows a shaft to be retained in the output.
Face Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted to the face of a bracket or tube in several useful orientations.
Side Mounting Holes
- These 10-32 holes allow the gearbox to be mounted on top of structural components without obstructing the front of the gearbox.
Threaded Assembly Holes
- The screws holding the gearbox together thread into these holes to clamp the gearbox stack together.
Input Spline
- Accepts torque from the last gear stage while being easy to insert and remove.
Alignment Tabs
- Alignment features that engage with the alignment notches on the last stage. The directional nature of the alignment features prevent the user from assembling any gearbox components backwards.
