Flap Wheels are used for intakes and conveyor systems to pick up irregular game pieces, playing a similar role to compliant wheels. ION Flap wheels feature cut marks every 3.2mm on the flaps for consistent cutting, allowing for versatility and adaptability for unique game pieces. The ION Flap wheels have a solid 1/2in Hex Hub molded into the wheel making sure more power is driven by the wheel. These wheels come in three different durometers, outlined below. As the tread durometer increases the compliant flap gets harder which will change traction, wear, and compliance of the flap.

2024 REV ION FRC Starter Bot Intake Design
2024 REV ION FRC Starter Bot Intake
On the 2024 REV ION FRC Starter Bot, the flap wheels on the intake aid in grabbing the CRESCENDO game pieces to be secured for the launcher.
