The REV Robotics Expansion Hub (
REV-31-1153
) is a low-cost educational device that can communicate with any computer (commonly the
REV Robotics Control Hub
or an Android Phone) to provide the interfaces required for building robots and other mechatronics. The Expansion Hub was purpose built to stand up to the rigors of the classroom and competition field. It features a mature firmware designed for basic and advanced use cases with the ability to be field upgraded in the future.
The IO ports of the Expansion Hub are identical in specification to the Control Hub. Within this documentation, many sections may refer to the Control Hub, but the connections are the same for the Expansion Hub.
The REV Robotics Expansion Hub is an approved device for use in the FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Global.

Specifications
The following tables provide the operating and mechanical specifications for the Expansion Hub.
DO NOT exceed the absolute maximum electrical specifications. Doing so will cause permanent damage to the Expansion Hub and will void the warranty.
