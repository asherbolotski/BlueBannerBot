Getting Started!
This year's Starter Bot program offers a slightly more technical solution than previous years. If your team is new to FTC, or in need of a review, we strongly recommend checking out our updated
Hello Robot Programming Guide
before diving in!
To begin, let's take a look at the configuration and actuators used in this year's design.
Configuration
Before getting started with programming we needed to create a
configuration file
. Below is an overview of how the robot is configured for the TeleOp code to function as expected:

Gamepad Setup
The 2024-25 REV DUO FTC Starter Bot is designed to use a split arcade drive for the default. Check out our
Upgrades
page for the arcade drive version of the program.
In split arcade drive, the left joystick will control forward and reverse motion of the robot, and the right joystick will control turning. This is similar to how some RC cars are driven and video games are played.
Not all gamepads have buttons labeled the same way. Check the manufacturer's documentation for accurate button mapping.

More information on programming gamepads for use with your robot can be found at
Hello Robot - Using Gamepads
.
The REV USB PS4 Compatible Gamepad (REV-31-2983) has two remappable M-buttons on the back side of the controller. By default, these are mapped to circle and cross.
Please see the product page for directions on remapping these buttons.
