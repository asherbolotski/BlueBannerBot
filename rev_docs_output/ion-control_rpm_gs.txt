Utilizing 18V Passive PoE with two socketed RJ45 connectors, the Radio Power Module passes signal between the radio and roboRIO while providing power directly to the radio. Connect an ethernet cable into each end of the Radio Power Module, connect the NI roboRIO port to the roboRIO, then connected the Wi-Fi Radio Power port to the radio. Once the Radio Power Module is connected, add power through the low-current channel on the Power Distribution Hub.
Low-current Channel Fuse
5A or higher
Make sure to double check the Ethernet cables are plugged into the correct port and device when using the Radio Power Module. Connecting the roboRIO to the Wi-Fi Radio Ethernet port can cause permanent damage to the roboRIO.
