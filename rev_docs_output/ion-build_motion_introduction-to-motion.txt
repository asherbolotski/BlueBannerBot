Transmitting Motion
is the act of getting motion from one part of the robot to another using shafts, sprockets, gears, etc.
Transforming Motion
is the act of changing the turning force (torque) and speed. Torque and speed are inverse to each other, meaning when one increases the other decreases. Several of the same components that transmit motion are also used to transform motion (sprockets and chain, belts and pulleys, and gears).
The core component to transmitting motion on a robot is a shaft. They come in many shapes and styles, but the goal of each shaft is to transmit motion to other components
One of the main components in transmitting motion in the REV ION Build System is 1/2in Hex (hexagonal, six sided) shape. 1/2in Hex is featured in components where a MAXSpline is too large or when motion needs to be directly transmitted to a 1/2in Hex shaft. 1/2in Hex shafts are available in a number of different lengths and can be cut to length if needed.
Another important shape for transmitting motion in the REV ION Build System is the MAXSpline. This shape is incorporated into the other main motion components such as: MAXHubs, sprockets, gears, wheels, pulleys, and MAXSpline shaft.
The two primary systems used for transmitting motion in the REV ION Build System are gears and sprockets with chain.
