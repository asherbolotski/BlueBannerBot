15mm Extrusion Basics
The 15mm profile of the
Extrusion
has slots on on all four sides that accept standard
M3 hardware
. Rather than using a T-nut, which is more expensive,  slide a M3 hex head screw along the slot and adjust brackets and other build materials as needed. As illustrated in the image above, the ends of the Extrusion also have a 5mm hole
pitch
that can be M3 tappped.
To learn more about extrusion systems versus pitch systems return to the
Structure Page
.

Various options
Extrusion can be cut to shorter lengths as needed
When to Use?
The flexibility of the 15mm Extrusion makes it a great option for arms, lifts, and other robot manipulators and mechanisms. This is one of the most compact structure pieces and allows for compact designs. Depending on the design and use case, you may wish to add additional supports to avoid twisting under high loads, also known as torsion.
To help with joints you may need Extrusions with beveled edges. To learn more see the
Joint
section.
How to Use?
The point of the extrusion system is to offer more flexibility in design than would come in a fixed pitch system. The
slots
in the extrusion allow brackets and other components to be slid along the 15mm Extrusion to an infinite number of positions
The illustration above shows how easy it is to swap, adjust and iterate designs. This works for gear mating, chain tensioning, and bracket adjustments as you are iterating.
