Drivetrain Bumper Kit Assembly Instructions
The guide below shows how to install the Drivetrain Bumper Kit at the standard height. To install the bumpers in the high configuration, follow the below guide but flip the brackets so that the taller side is protruding up from the drivetrain.
1) Insert a 10-32 button head x 2-1/2in screw in the MAXTube at the front of your drivetrain as shown, secure it with a 10-32 Nylon Nut. Insert a 10-32 Button Head Screws x 1-1/2in in the MAXTube on the side of your Drivetrain as shown, secure it with a 10-32 Nylon Nut. Do the same for all four corners of your Drivetrain.
2) Side the Bumper Bracket onto the screws installed in the previous step. Fasten the Bracket with two 10-32 Flanged Wing Nuts. Do the same for all four corners of your Drivetrain.

If you are finding it difficult to slide the Bumper Bracket on and off, you can enlarge the mounting hole with a step-bit or a standard drill bit to allow for easier installation and removal.
3) Slide your bumpers around your brackets and at the height you want them mounted. Screw a 10 x 5/8in Flat Head Wood Screw into the the bumpers on each end of the bracket as shown. 

If you are unable to screw into the bumpers while your brackets are attached to your drivetrain, you can instead mark available holes then go to the next step.
4) Remove the Bumpers from your drivetrain and install the remaining 10 x 5/8in Flat Head Wood Screws into each bracket.
5) Place your bumpers back onto your drivetrain, fasten the bumpers with the 10-32 Flanged Wing Nuts.
