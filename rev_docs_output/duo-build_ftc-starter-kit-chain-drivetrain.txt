This section outlines the steps required to build a four-wheel, extrusion-based chain drivetrain using parts from the FTC Starter Kit V3 (
REV-45-1883
). This design is a good starting point. However, modification maybe required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed. This design is flexible, allowing for different wheel types depending on the overall requirements of the drive train.
The assembly of this drivetrain is broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each section begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of required materials for all sections is listed below.
