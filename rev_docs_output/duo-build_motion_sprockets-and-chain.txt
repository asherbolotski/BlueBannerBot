Sprocket Basics
Sprockets are rotating parts that have teeth and can be used with a chain and another sprocket to transmit torque. Sprockets and chain can be used to change the speed, torque or direction of a motor. For sprockets and chain to be compatible with each other, they must have the same thickness and pitch.
Sprocket and chain is a very efficient way to transmit torque over long distances.
Sprockets consist of a disk with straight teeth projecting radially. Sprockets will only work correctly with chain and other sprockets if they are on parallel shafts and the teeth are in the same plane. A chain consists of a continuous set of links that ride on the sprockets to transmit motion. The REV 15mm Build System is designed around #25 Roller Chain (
REV-41-1365
) using compatible
#25 Sprockets
.
Anatomy of a Sprocket
The most common and important features of a sprocket are called out in the figure below.
Number of Teeth
Pitch Diameter
Pitch
Outside Diameter
Chain Clearance Diameter
Number of Teeth
is the total count of the
number of teeth
(projections) around the whole circumference of a sprocket. For sprockets with very few teeth this number is easily physically counted, but for high tooth counts this may not be isn’t very practical.
Pitch Diameter (PD)
is an imaginary circle which is traced by the center of the chain pins when the sprocket rotates while meshed with a chain. The ratio of the
pitch diameter
between sprockets can be used to calculate the gear ratio, but more commonly and much more simply the ratio of the
number of teeth
is used for this calculation.
Pitch
represents the amount of
pitch diameter
in inches per tooth. Sprockets with a larger
pitch
will have bigger teeth. Common pitches are 0.25”, known as #25, and 0.375” (#35). The REV Robotics building system uses #25 chain.
Outside Diameter (OD)
will always be larger than the
pitch diameter
but smaller than the
chain clearance diameter
. The
outside diameter
does not account for the additional diameter added by the chain, so it should not be used to check for assembly interference.
Chain Clearance Diameter
is the outside diameter of a sprocket with chain wrapped around it. The
chain clearance diameter
will always be larger than the
pitch diameter
and the
outside diameter
. The
chain clearance diameter
should be used when checking for interference when placing sprockets very close to other structures.
Anatomy of Chain
Roller chain is used to connect two sprockets together and transfer torque. Roller chain is made up of a series of inner and outer links connected together which forms a flexible strand.
Outside Links
Inside Links
Pitch
Outside Links
consist of two outside plates which are connected by two
pins
that are pressed into each plate. The
pins
in the outside link go through the inside of the hollow
bushings
when the inner and outer links are assembled. The
pins
can freely rotate on the inside of the
bushings
.
Inside Link
consist of two inside plates that are connected by two hollow
bushings
which are pressed into each plate. The teeth of the sprocket contact the surface of the
bushings
when the chain is wrapped around a sprocket.
Pitch
is the distance between the centers of two adjacent
pins
. Common pitches are 0.25”, known as #25, and 0.375” (#35). The REV 15mm Building System uses #25 chain.
Product Specifications
The REV DUO Build System includes both
Metal
and
Plastic
Sprockets. The table below covers some of the basic specifications for the different types of Sprockets.
Plastic
Metal
Material
Acetal (Delrin/POM)
6061 Aluminum
Thickness
15mm
3mm (15mm with Locking Motion Hub)
REV DUO sprockets are a #25 pitch. Plastic Sprockets are designed to fit a 5mm hex shaft which eliminates the need for special hubs and setscrews. Most Metal Sprockets use a Locking Motion Hub (
REV-41-1719
) in order to connect to a
Hex Shaft
. The REV DUO Metal Sprockets are at less risk for wear than the Plastic Sprockets.
All REV DUO Plastic Sprockets have a M3 bolt hole mounting pattern that is on an 8mm pitch. This makes it easy to directly mount REV DUO
Brackets
and
Extrusion
to sprockets. The 8mm pitch is also compatible with many other building systems.
Using Sprockets and Chain as a Powertrain
Transforming the
torque
and
speed
of the motion is accomplished by changing the size of the sprockets.
Physics concepts, like speed and power, have a lot of applications in the REV 15mm Build System. To learn more about them, check out how they apply to sprockets and chains
here
.
A
sprocket size ratio
is the relationship between the number of teeth of two sprockets (input and output). In the image below, the input sprocket is a 15 tooth sprocket and the output is a 20 tooth. The sprocket size ratio for the example is 20T:15T. The ratio in size from the
input
(driving) sprocket to the
output
(driven) sprocket determines if the output is
faster
(less torque) or has more
torque
(slower).
To learn more about ratio calculations for sprockets check out the
ratio
section.
The 15 tooth sprocket outside of the chain loop is known as an
idler
. Idlers do not affect the sprocket size ratio and thus are not part of the calculation. To learn more about idlers check out
Idler
section on the Advanced Sprockets and Chain page.
Within a chain loop, motion follows the direction set by the input sprocket. In the example, both sprockets inside the chain loop move counter clockwise. Idlers, which sit outside of the chain loop, are pushed in the opposing direction. So, the 15 tooth idler sprocket is moving clockwise.
How to Use REV DUO Sprockets and Chain?
Like with other motion components, REV DUO Sprockets drive motion with the 5mm Hex Shaft. However, in order to use a Hex Shaft with the Metal Sprockets, a Locking Motion Hub will also need to be used. To learn more about using Hex Shafts and proper motion support and constraint visit the pages linked below:
Hex Shaft and Spacers
Supporting Motion
Constraining Motion
Chain Tension
In order for sprockets to work effectively, it’s important that the
center-to-center distance
is correctly adjusted. The sprocket and chain example with the red 'X', in the image below, may work under very light loads, but they will certainly not work and will skip under any significant loading. The sprockets in this example are too close together so chain is loose enough that it can skip on the sprocket teeth. The sprockets, with the green check mark, are correctly spaced which will provide smooth reliable operation.
To learn more about calculating center-to-center distance for sprockets visit the
Advance Sprockets and Chain Page
.
To ensure proper chain tension it is recommended to create a properly sized chain loop. To learn more about manipulating chain to size check out the
Chain Tool
page.
The first step to getting ideal chain tension is to manipulate, or cut the chain to the correct size. Using the center-to-center distance calculation is one of the most accurate ways to find the chain size needed. Once sizing is approximated, use the Chain Tool (
REV-41-1442
) or Master Link (
REV-41-1366
) to break and reform the chain.
To learn more about using the Chain Tool and Master Link, check out the
Chain Tool
section
When using the slots on REV DUO structural elements its is very easy to adjust and tension the chain if the sizing is off. When using the
Extended Motion Pattern
in conjunction with a chain drive, use Tensioning Bushings (
REV-41-1702
) and Standoffs (
REV-41-1492
).
For an example on how to use the Tensioning Bushings check out the
Drivetrain
guide.
Sprocket Alignment Mark
Sometimes in a design it may be desirable to stack together multiple of the same sprocket on a shaft. In the cases where the number of teeth on the sprocket is not divisible by six, because of how they are oriented when put onto the hex shaft, the teeth may not be aligned between the two sprockets. To ensure all of the sprockets are clocked the same way, use the alignment shaft notch to put all the gears on the shaft with the same orientation.
