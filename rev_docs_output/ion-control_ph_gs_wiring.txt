The Pneumatic Hub is powered off of one of the three Power Distribution Hub side channels (not the switchable side channel) and can be wired into the CAN bus using the yellow and green channel ports.
It's recommended to use a 20A circuit breaker on the low-current channel where the Pneumatic Hub is wired.

Always make sure the Pneumatic Hub is disconnected from any power source before adding or modifying connections.
Wiring the Power Input (12 Volt Supply - Battery, Power Supply, etc.)
Use 24-16 AWG Wire, Stripped back ~0.375” (9mm)
Make sure that a red colored wire is connected to the red/positive ( + ) terminals and that the black colored wire is connected to the black/negative ( - ) terminals. Press and hold down connector button.
Insert wire into connector opening
Release connector button
Test the wire by giving it a
smart tug
to ensure wire is connected securely.
Visually inspect to make sure no stray wires are outside of the connector port
Smart Tug
- tugging on a wire to test the connection with a reasonable amount of force.
Wiring the Compressor
Use 24-16 AWG Wire, Stripped back ~0.375” (9mm)
Make sure that a red colored wire is connected to the red/positive ( + ) terminals and that the black colored wire is connected to the black/negative ( - ) terminals. Press and hold down connector button.
Insert wire into connector opening
Release connector button
Test the wire by giving it a
smart tug
to ensure wire is connected securely.
Visually inspect to make sure no stray wires are outside of the connector port
To test your Compressor and Pressure Relief Valve, use
Compressor Test Mode!
Wiring the Digital Pressure Switch
The digital pressure switch should be wired to the Digital Sensor Port on the PH. The polarity of the digital switch does not matter and can be wired in either direction.
Wiring an Analog Pressure Sensor
Most sensors that connect to analog input ports will have three wires - signal, power, and ground - corresponding precisely to the three pins of the analog input ports - see highlighted legend pic below
Additionally, some sensors may need to connect to multiple analog input ports in order to function. In general, these sensors will only ever require a single power and a single ground pin - only the signal pin of the additional port(s) will be needed.
The Analog Pressure Sensor port is a very tight fit and requires special attention
1) Insert the 3 pin sensor connector at an angle on the sloped part of the case
2) Pivot the connector so its horizontal
3) Push the connector along the slot into position above the pins
4) Push down to plug in the connector
Wiring the Solenoids (please read caution below)
Use 24 AWG wire, Stripped back ~0.375” (9mm) Press and hold down connector button.
Insert wire into connector opening
Release connector button
Test the wire by giving it a
smart tug
to ensure wire is connected securely.
Visually inspect to make sure no stray wires are outside of the connector port
set single acting vs double acting
Ensure voltage is set for solenoids before applying power, using a mix of 12V and 24V is not supported
Wiring the CAN bus
Use 24 AWG - 18 AWG Wire, Stripped back ~0.375” (9mm) Press and hold down connector button.
Insert wire into connector opening
Release connector button
Test the wire by giving it a
smart tug
to ensure wire is connected securely.
Visually inspect to make sure no stray wires are outside of the connector port
The Pneumatic Hub does not come with a terminating resistor.
Building Pressure!
The complexity of your pneumatic system is dependent on your design and governed by the tightly defined FRC robot rules. Because of the number of variables inherent in these systems, we do not cover them within this documentation. There are, however, several references we can suggest!
