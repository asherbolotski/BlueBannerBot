15mm x 45mm C Channel Basics
The
C Channel
uses a combination of a
fixed pitch system
and an
extrusion system
to make it easy to iterate robot designs. The Channel system overall is compatible with standard
M3 hardware
, and is designed to work seamlessly with existing
15mm Extrusion
and
15mm x 30mm Extrusion
. The extrusion system has slots that allows flexible bracket positions for easy Channel to Extrusion connection.
The 45mm wide side of the channel features the
Extended Motion Pattern
which uses M3 hardware for attaching brackets, extrusion, and channel together. Locations for mounting bearings, shafts, motors, and servos are available every 16mm. Slots on the 15mm sections of the channel accept standard M3 hex-head bolts or nuts, rather than expensive t-nuts.
Product Specifications
Material: 6063 aluminum
Height: 45mm
Width: 15mm
Length:
Various lengths
Channel can be cut to length if necessary, but care should be taken to ensure cuts preserve the necessary portions of the motion pattern for the overall robot design
When to Use?
The C Channels are great for creating a sturdy
robot drivetrain
or for use in areas where additional
torsional strength
is needed.
Torsional Strength
is a measure of the ability of a material to withstand a twisting load.
To learn more about why torsional strength is helpful to your robot design visit the
constraining motion
page
How to Use?
The combination of the pitch and extrusion systems featured on the C channel allows flexibility in design and iterations. The extended motion pattern featured on the 15mm x 45mm C Channel allows for easy placement of moving parts, for addition constraint and support of motion. The extended motion pattern can also allow easier replacement or swapping of parts on interior portions of the robot than the 15mm Extrusion, depending on robot design.
For some examples on how to use the C Channel check out the
Differential Drivetrain Guide
.
