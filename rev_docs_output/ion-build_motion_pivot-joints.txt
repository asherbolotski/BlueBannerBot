1in Pivot Joint Example Applications

The ION 1in Pivot Joint (
REV-21-2395-PK2
) can be used in numerous ways within the ION Build System to create a pivot joint at the end of a piece of MAXTube - 1x1 or 2x1 with Grid Structure.
1in Pivot Joint (REV-21-2395-PK2)
Constraining Motion
For designs where one or more MAXTubing needs to behave fixedly, like an elbow or a hinge. The
Pivot Joint can constrain MAXTubing, allowing for rotational movement around a fixed axis for many degrees of rotation.
First, cut two 1x1 Extrusions to the desired length.
Next, insert four #10-32 x 3/8in Button Head Drive Screws into opposite sides of the Pivot Joint. Repeat for the other Pivot Joint.
Then, place a Tapped 1in 1/2in Hex Shaft into one of the Pivot Joints, and sandwich the two Pivot Joints together. Insert two #10-32 Shaft End Screws into the Hex Shaft to secure the assembly.

Supporting Motion
If your design calls for moving structures, the 1in Pivot Joint can serve as a shaft bearing to support a wheel. This allows a fixed point to have rotational movement, similar to the example picture.
First, cut the 1in Extrusion to the desired length.
Next, insert four #10-32 x 3/8in Button Head Drive Screws into opposite sides of the Pivot Joint.
Then, place a Tapped 1in 1/2in Hex Shaft into one of the Pivot Joints with a #10-32 Shaft End Screw.
From here, you will need to determine what size spacer would be best for your specific application. But in this example, a 1/4in Hex Spacer and a 1/8in Hex Spacer were used.
Finally, slide your Compliant wheel loaded with 1/2in Hex MAXHubs on the shaft and secured everything with a #10-32 End Screw.
