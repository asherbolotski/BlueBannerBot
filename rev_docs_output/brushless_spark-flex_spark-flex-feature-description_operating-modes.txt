Brushed/Brushless Mode - Motor Type
This mode is only compatible with the SPARK Flex Dock (coming soon). More information about this mode will be available once the dock is available.
Brake/Coast Mode - Idle Behavior
When the SPARK Flex is receiving a neutral command the idle behavior of the motor can be handled in two different ways:
Braking
or
Coasting
.
When in
Brake Mode
, the SPARK Flex will effectively short all motor wires together. This quickly dissipates any electrical energy within the motor and brings it to a quick stop.
When in
Coast Mode
, the SPARK Flex will effectively disconnect all motor wires. This allows the motor to spin down at its own rate.
The Idle Mode can be configured using the Mode Button, CAN, and USB interfaces.
Mode Button Configuration
Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the Mode Button.
Please follow the
Pressing the SPARK Flex Mode Button guide
before continuing.
Use a small
straightened paper clip
or other
small blunt tool
to press the button. Never use a sharp tool or any type of pencil, as the pencil lead can break off inside the SPARK Flex.
Connect the SPARK Flex to main power, not just USB Power.
The Status LED will indicate which Idle Mode is currently configured by blinking blue or cyan for Brake and yellow or magenta for Coast depending on the motor type.
Press and release the Mode Button
You should see the Status LED change to indicate the selected Idle Mode.
Please see the
Status LED Patterns guide
for information on how to identify the Idle Behavior configuration by the color of the Status LED!
USB Configuration
Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the USB and the REV Hardware Client application. Be sure to download and install the REV Hardware Client application before continuing.
Connect the SPARK Flex to your computer using a USB-C cable.
Open the REV Hardware Client application and verify that the application is connected to your SPARK Flex.
On the
Basic
tab, select the desired mode with the
Idle Mode
switch.
Click
Update Configuration
and confirm the change.
CAN Configuration
Please see the API Information for information on how to configure the SPARK Flex using the CAN interface.
Recovery Mode
In the rare case where a firmware update has been interrupted or corrupted, it may be necessary to boot the SPARK Flex into Recovery Mode. This can be done by following the steps below. Have a computer running the REV Hardware Client and a USB cable ready in order to reload the device firmware once the device is in Recovery Mode.
Please follow the
Pressing the SPARK Flex Mode Button guide
before continuing.
Use a small
straightened paper clip
or other
small blunt tool
to press the button. Never use a sharp tool or any type of pencil, as the pencil lead can break off inside the SPARK Flex.
Start with all power disconnected from the SPARK Flex.
Press and hold the Mode Button.
While still holding the Mode Button, connect power by either turning on main power or connecting the USB cable between the SPARK Flex and the computer.
Once powered, you may release the Mode Button. The LED should stay dark. The SPARK Flex is now in Recovery Mode.
If the firmware is not booting properly, it may not be easy to know if the device has entered Recovery Mode since the LED will be dark in both cases. To confirm that the SPARK Flex is in Recovery Mode:
Connect the USB cable between the SPARK Flex and computer if not already connected.
In the REV Hardware Client, the SPARK Flex should show up as a Recovery Mode Device when scanning for devices.
If the device doesn't show up, please repeat the process, ensuring that the power and button holding sequence is followed exactly. If the device still doesn't show up, please contact REV Support.
