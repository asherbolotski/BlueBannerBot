MAXPlanetary Base Kits purchased before 11/14/2022 included a MAXPlanetary CIM/Falcon Spacer (REV-21-2119) to ensure that the input stage for CIM, MiniCIM, and Falcon 500 motors sits correctly in the MAXPlanetary Gearbox. Please be sure to install the spacer before assembling your MAXPlanetary Gearbox and attaching the Input Stage to your motor.
Spacer Assembly Guide
The following steps are only required if you are using a CIM, MiniCIM, or Falcon Motor
1) Place the MAXPlanetary CIM/Falcon Spacer onto your motor.
2) Align two of the mounting holes on the motor with the holes in the spacer.
You are now ready to continue assembling your MAXPlanetary Gearbox!
