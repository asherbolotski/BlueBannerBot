Servo Hub Overview
The REV Servo Hub is compatible with both the REV ION and REV DUO systems. Over a single communication interface it can provide advanced control of up to six (6) servos. This means that the Servo Hub needs no additional PWM cabling between it and your robot controller, greatly simplifying wiring.
Future firmware updates will unlock additional features like current measurements for each output channel, CAN communication, control individual channel power to enable powered-off servo states, and even adjustable output voltage to provide adaptability to a wide range of servo classes.
The Servo Hub is easy to update and configure over the USB-C connection utilizing the REV Hardware Client. With a total current output of 15A shared across all channels, the Servo Hub will give you the power you need to succeed on the field!

About the Maximum Current Specifications
Each of the Servo Hub's individual port pins are rated for approximately 3 A. This rating, of the port itself, highly depends on the quality of the connection between the Servo Hub and the connector of the servo it is driving.
The Servo Hub has been designed with powerful servos in mind.  Many of REV's customers' favorite servos have a stall current of 4 Amps or more. While we don't believe the 4 A stall current will produce enough heat to cause problems with a properly seated and quality connection, a poor connection can cause overheating and thermal runaway that can lead to damage.
The best way to ensure you are making the most of your Servo Power Module's output, is to check that all input and output connections are fully seated with no gaps.
Output Current Calculations
It is important to ensure that you do not exceed the maximum total output current of your Servo Power Module. To do this, add together the stall current of each servo being powered by the Servo Power Module. If the total stall current is higher than 15A, you risk triggering the overcurrent protection. Consider reducing the number of servos connected to prevent triggering the overcurrent protections.
