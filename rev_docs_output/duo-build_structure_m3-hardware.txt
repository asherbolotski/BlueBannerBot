M3 Hardware Basics
The REV DUO build system uses
M3 hardware
to connect, or fasten, brackets and structure together on a robot. Different applications require different length screws. When attaching a bracket to extrusion, shorter screws are generally required. Use longer screws to connect Control System components and other thicker materials.
See the
“Tips and Tricks”
section of this guide for best practices when working with the M3 Hardware.
Tools
We include all the tools needed to use the parts in the FTC Starter Kit. Take a moment to identify the tools below:
5.5mm Nut Driver (
REV-41-1119
)
5.5mm Combination Wrench (
REV-41-1374
)
Allen Wrench Pack (1.5mm (
REV-41-1376
), 2mm (
REV-41-1377
), and 2.5mm Allen Wrenches)
#25 Chain Tool (
REV-41-1442
)
As robots become more complex, there are additional tools, hardware, and fasteners available on the REV website:
5.5mm Ratcheting Combination Wrench (
REV-49-1711
)
Metric Step Drill (
REV-49-1455
) for drilling holes of different sizes
Zip Ties (
REV-41-1161
)
Hook and Loop Fastener (
REV-41-1373
)
Variety of replacement screws, and additional screw lengths
T-Slot Screws
Another type of hardware included in the kit is the T-Slot Screw (
REV-41-1907
). These screws have a T-shaped head allowing them to drop in the slots of the
Extrusion
or
C Channel
. This allows for modification of an existing design by adding in brackets and structure without needing access to the end of a slot.
Even though T-Slot Screws are convenient, it is always recommended to use full Hex Head Screws because they are a stronger fastener.
Product Specs
Material: Corrosion resistant zinc plated steel
Length: 8mm
How to Use?
Simply drop the t-slot screws into the channel where you want them to go and attach the brackets or structures you want and tighten until
snug
.
