Recommended for use on drivetrains, ION Traction Wheels (
Product Family Page
) come in a wide range of sizes, durometers, bores and material. Larger wheels contain the MAXSpline, but can be adapted to other bores with a separate
MAXHub
. Wheels with spokes have a bolt circle of #10 clearance holes patterned outward at 1/2in pitch and also have a 3/8in wide nut groove, which removes the need for a wrench when utilizing the holes on the spokes. Multiple wheels can be mounted flush next to each other when more surface area is needed.
