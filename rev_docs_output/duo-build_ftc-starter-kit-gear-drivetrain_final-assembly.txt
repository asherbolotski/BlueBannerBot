Final Assembly Steps
The following steps include meshing gears in order to build the power train. If you are unfamiliar with how to properly space gears please our
Gear Spacing
article.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the Internal Chassis Frame as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The edge of the Lap Corner Brackets should be flush with the end of the Extrusion.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the Internal Chassis Frame as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The Lap Corner Brackets should have enough space from the edge of the space  to slide in a 15mm Extrusion.
Slide a 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Brackets until the Extrusion is roughly central to the center of the Internal Chassis Frame center.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the 15mm Extrusion – 420mm as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The Lap Corner Brackets should have enough space from the edge of the space  to slide in a 15mm Extrusion.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the 15mm Extrusion – 420mm as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The edge of the Lap Corner Brackets should be flush with the end of the Extrusion
Slide two 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets as shown.
The ends of the Extrusions should be flush with the edge of the perpendicular Extrusion. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to the Omni Wheel Assembly.
Slide the Omni Wheel Assembly onto the under side of the Chassis as shown in the image.
Repeat the two previous steps to add the second Omni Wheel Assembly to the other side of the Chassis Assembly. Adjust wheels and tighten Nylock Nuts.
Note:
You will want the Omni Wheel Assemblies to be even. A good way of ensuring they are even is to use one of the Cross Members as a reference point as show in the image.
Slide an UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly along the 15mm Extrusion - 420mm of the Internal Chassis Frame, until the 45 Tooth Plastic Gear is meshed with the gear of the Omni Wheel Assembly.  Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
Ensure that the pre-loaded M3 x 8mm Screws on both brackets are interlocked with the Extrusion slots.
Repeat the two previous steps to add the second UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly to the other side of the Chassis Assembly.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to a Gear Idler Assembly.
Slide the Gear Idler Assembly onto the under side of the Chassis as shown in the image. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The Gear on the Gear Idler Assembly should be messed with the gear on the Omni Wheel Assembly.
Repeat the two previous steps to add another Gear Idler Assembly to the other side of the Chassis.
Remove two of the Inside Cross Member by loosening the screws on the Inside Corner Brackets, as shown in the  image. Set the Inside Cross Members aside for later
Add two Pre-Loaded 15mm Plastic Indexable Motion Brackets to the Middle Grip Wheel Assembly.
Note:
Notice that both Indexable Motion Brackets are facing the same direction
Slide the Middle Grip Wheel Assembly onto the chassis.
Repeat the previous two steps to add the second Middle Grip Assembly onto the other side of the chassis.
Add the Inside Cross Members back to chassis.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to a Gear Idler Assembly.
Slide the Gear Idler Assembly onto the under side of the Chassis as shown in the image. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The Gear on the Gear Idler Assembly should be messed with the gear on the Omni Wheel Assembly.
Repeat the two previous steps to add another Gear Idler Assembly to the other side of the Chassis.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to a Front Grip Wheel Assembly.
Slide the Front Grip Wheel Assembly onto the under side of the Chassis as shown in the image.
Repeat the two previous steps to add another Front Grip Wheel Assembly to the other side of the Chassis.
Add 8 Pre-loaded Lap Corner Brackets onto the  ends of the extrusions. See next step for placement.
The Lap Corner Brackets will be used to slide in the final piece of Extrusion to close the Chassis.
Four brackets will be flush with the end of the exposed Extrusions and used to support the bottom of the Extrusions. The Other Four will be used to support the side of the Extrusions as seen in the image.
Slide a 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Brackets until the Extrusion is seated through all brackets.
