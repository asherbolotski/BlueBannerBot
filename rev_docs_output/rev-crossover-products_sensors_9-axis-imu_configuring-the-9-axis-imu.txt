To use the 9-Axis IMU the Control Hub must be running Robot Controller App v10.0 or newer.
A full configuration walkthrough is available here.
The 9-Axis IMU is configured similar to other I2C devices. First, navigate to the Control Hub Portal or Expansion Hub where it is connected in the configuration menu.
Configuration menu on the Driver Hub
Next, scroll to find the option to add something to the I2C Bus.
Note:
The internal IMU appears in I2C Bus 0. For this example, we are adding the 9-Axis IMU to I2C Bus 1.

Once in the menu, click "Add". This will show the option to add a new sensor to this I2C Bus.

When "Setup Code for Configured Hardware" is checked while creating a new OpMode in OnBot Java, the IMU will automatically be added to the hardwareMap using the assigned name from configuration.
An internal IMU, if applicable, will retain its default name based on the version of IMU (BNO055 or BHI260AP).
