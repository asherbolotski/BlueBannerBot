When to use?
The alloy of aluminum used in the flat plate makes it more malleable than other structure pieces in the 15mm Build System. Utilize the flat plate to create curved aspects for your robot like a shooter hood, an intake, or a bumper.
How to Use?
Step 1: Approximate the diameter of the curve you want.
Step 2: Find an object, like a can, that is close to the diameter you need.
Step 3: Adjust the flat plate around the object with your hands or hand tools until you reach your desired curve.
