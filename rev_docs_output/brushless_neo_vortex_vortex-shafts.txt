NEO Vortex Shaft Features
Vortex shafts feature a 1/2 in hex section for transferring torque, and a locating taper section for effortless self-centering. When the shaft is secured with a #10-32 Shaft End Screw, the taper keeps your shaft perfectly centered as it's drawn in and locked into place within the NEO Vortex Spindle.

Name, SKU, and Function
1/2 in Hex Shaft - Any Length
(
Multiple SKU
)
The NEO Vortex's 1/2in hex through-bore motor spindle is compatible with any length hex shaft.
Vortex Shaft - 8 mm
(
REV-21-2807
)

The 8mm Vortex Shaft, compatible with the
REV ION System
, empowers you to utilize the NEO Vortex Brushless Motor with any 8mm keyed shaft component. This interchangeability also means that the NEO Vortex matches the output of a
NEO Brushless Motor V1.1
, making it a seamless drop-in replacement for your designs.
Vortex Shaft - MAXSwerve Integrated Key (
REV-21-2848
)

The Vortex Shaft - MAXSwerve Integrated Key gives users the ability to drive a MAXSwerve Module without the need for the MAXSwerve Key. This eliminates a potential point of failure in the MAXSwerve since the key is machined directly into the 8mm shaft.
Vortex Shaft - 20 DP Gear - 7 T
(
REV-21-6800
)

The Vortex Shaft - 20 DP Gear - 7 T offers users the unique ability to achieve substantial gear reductions directly from the motor. This gear features a 7 T 20 DP design that is typically too small for an 8mm keyed input. However, it becomes possible when integrated into the motor shaft.
The Vortex Shaft - 20 DP Gear - 7 T is addendum shifted to an 8 T pitch diameter. This allows you to calculate center-to-center distances as if it were an 8 T gear rather than a 7 T.
Vortex Shaft - MAXPlanetary Input Kit
(
REV-21-2130
)

Working seamlessly with the MAXPlanetary Vortex Input Stage, the Vortex Shaft - MAXPlanetary Input Coupler reduces gearbox length for more efficient designs. Note that the MAXPlanetary Vortex Input Stage is required for this setup.
Vortex Shaft - Falcon Compatible Spline
(
REV-21-2827
)

The Vortex Shaft - Falcon Compatible Spline gives users the ability to drive components that have a falcon spline bore.
