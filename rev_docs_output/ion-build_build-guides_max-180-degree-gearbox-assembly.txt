The 180 Degree Output can be assembled with two different Ratios, a 1:1 ratio for balance output and a  2:1 Ratio when more torque is needed. The two Ratios require separate assemblies, both are detailed below.
1:1 Ratio Assembly
1) Add two 8mm Shaft Spacers to the NEO Brushless Motor output shaft.
2) Insert the NEO Shaft Key.
3) Slide the 1/2 Hex Shaft Adapter to the NEO output shaft.
4) Fasten the base plate to the NEO using the left holes in the base plate and two #10-32 x 1/2in screws with a 1/8in Allen Key.
5)Press a Flanged Bearing into the base with the flanged side opposite of the NEO.
6) Press a 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft into the Flanged Bearing.
7) Slide a 1/8 MAXSpline Spacer onto the  1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
8) Screw together two MAXSpline Pulley halves with six M3x12mm screws.
9) Screw together two MAXSpline to 1/2 Hex Adapter halves with two #12-32x1/2in Socket Head screws with a 5/32in Allen Key.
10) Screw together two MAXSpline Pulley halves with six M3x12mm screws.
11) Place the 48-tooth RT25 Belt around both the NEO Pulley and MAXSpline Pulley, then slide them onto the Output Shaft of the NEO and 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft at the same time.
12) Secure the NEO Pulley with a Retaining Ring.
13) Slide a 1/8 and a 1/16 MAXSpline Spacer onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
14) Press a Bearing onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
15) Press the Pulley Cover Plate onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft Bearing.
16) Secure the Pulley Cover Plate with three #10-32 x1-1/2in screws and #10 Spacers using a 1/8in Allen Key.
2:1 Ratio Assembly
1) Fasten the base plate to the NEO using the right holes in the base plate and two #10-32 x 1/2in screws with a 1/8in Allen Key.
2)Press a Flanged Bearing into the base with the flanged side opposite of the NEO.
3) Press a 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft into the Flanged Bearing.
4) Slide a 1/8 MAXSpline Spacer onto the  1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
5) Press a Retaining Ring onto the the Output Shaft of the NEO.
Please Note: You will adjust this placement later in step 7.
6)  Screw together two MAXSpline Pulley halves with six M3x12mm screws.
7) Place the 40-tooth RT25 Belt around both a 12tooth-RT25 Pulley and MAXSpline Pulley, then slide them onto the Output Shaft of the NEO and 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft at the same time.
Please Note: Adjust the Retaining Ring on the shaft of the NEO to make the 12tooth-RT25 pulley level with the MAXSpline Pulley.
8) Secure the 12tooth-RT25 Pulley with a second Retaining Ring.
9) Slide a 1/8 and a 1/16 MAXSpline Spacer onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
10) Press a Bearing onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft.
11) Press the Pulley Cover Plate onto the 1/2in Hex Through Bore Shaft Bearing.
12) Secure the Pulley Cover Plate with three #10-32 x1-1/2in screws and #10 Spacers using a 1/8in Allen Key.
