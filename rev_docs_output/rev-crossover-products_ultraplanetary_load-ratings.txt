Load Ratings
Ratings are based on testing conducted by REV Robotics on the UltraPlanetary system. All load ratings are based on a safety factor of 1.2 to accommodate manufacturing tolerances. The torques listed are for the output of the stage.

Torque
3:1 Cartridge
Fails at 40 N-m
4:1 Cartridge
Fails at 40 N-m
5:1 Cartridge
Fails at 40 N-m
Shock loads can cause the gearbox to fail in situations where the steady-state torque is still within allowable limits.
Cantilevered load on the output shaft puts additional stress on the gearbox and will reduce the torque the gearbox can withstand.
Cartridge Configuration
Cartridge configuration tables for UltraPlanetary use a red rating system. If the motor and gear ratio combination is highlighted in red, the torque created by the motor can damage the gearbox. Non-highlighted combinations are within acceptable torque ranges.
Nominal gear ratios are used to reference the cartridge for ease of use in the following charts. 
For actual gear ratios for an individual cartridge, please reference the
Actual Cartridge Gear Ratios Table.
The final actual gear ratios are indicated in the cells.
When building your gearbox, make sure the highest gear reduction is closest to the motor.
