Meet the 2025 REV ION FRC Starter Bot! Using the
REV ION Build System
, this starter bot is designed to give teams a starting point for building their robot while leaving room for iteration, revision, and adaptation to the gameâ€™s unique challenges.
Utilizing only REV ION parts, the 2025 REV ION Starter Bot will not require fabrication beyond cutting parts to length. This means your robot can be taken apart and reconfigured as the season evolves or parts can be reused to get a new prototype moving fast.
