Constructor Details
SparkSimFaultManager
public
SparkSimFaultManager
(
SparkMax
motor)
Create a Fault Manager object, which allows you to get and set the status of simulated faults
 on your simulated Spark MAX. Constructing this object will also cause the Fault Manager to
 appear in the sim gui. The state of faults can be fetched on the original Spark Object.
Parameters:
motor
- The CANSparkMax associated with the Fault Manager
