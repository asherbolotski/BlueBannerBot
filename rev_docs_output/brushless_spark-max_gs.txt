The SPARK MAX is a motor controller that can control both Brushed DC and Brushless DC motors. Out of the box, the MAX defaults to its Brushless Mode and is ready to drive a NEO Brushless Motor with its PWM interface. Included in this section are the basic steps to get a motor spinning using the REV Hardware Client as well as information on how to configure your SPARK MAX.
We recommend following this guide in its entirety at least once to understand the key features of the SPARK MAX. This guide can also serve as a fallback in case of any issues faced.
Before You Start
Before following this guide, the
REV Hardware Client should be installed
before continuing. The client is the best way to verify that the device is configured correctly, and is
required
before using the CAN interface.
