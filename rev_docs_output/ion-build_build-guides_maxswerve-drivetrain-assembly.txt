Getting Started
MAXSwerve Module Assembly
Before assembling your drivetrain you will first need to assembly your MAXSwerve Modules, follow the
MAXSwerve Module Assembly instructions
to assemble all four modules.
Cutting Guide
The MAXSwerve Drivetrain kit comes with full-length MAXTubes with endcaps and essential hardware, allowing you to customize the drivetrain's dimensions by cutting the tubes to fit your design. The image below will be used when going through this assembly guide. The guide will reference the extrusion labeled in this image.
Use the below instructions when cutting your extrusion to stay on pitch and ensure your drivetrain is assembled square.
Drivetrain Assembly
Get:
12 - MAXTube Internal Support 2x1
2 - MAXTube 2x1 with Grid Pattern - Side B
Insert 3 MAXTube Internal Supports into each end of the MAXTube pieces. Take care to ensure they do not fall out before securing them in the next step.
Get:
4 - MAXSwerve Module, fully assembled
12 - #10-32 Button Head Screws x 3in
12 - #10-32 Low Profile Nylon Lock Nut
2 - Assemblies from Step #1
Attach one MAXSwerve Module to each end of an 18in MAXTube piece. We recommend mounting one right-hand and one left-hand module so that the wires point toward each other.
Secure the MAXSwerve Modules to the MAXTube using screws so that each screw passes through a MAXTube Internal Support and the Nylon Lock Nt is on top.
Make two of these.
Get:
12 - MAXTube Internal Support 2x1
2 - MAXTube 2x1 with Grid Pattern - Side A
Insert 3 MAXTube Internal Supports into each end of the MAXTube pieces. Take care to ensure they do not fall out before securing them in the next step.
Get:
8 - #10-32 Button Head Screws x 3in
8 - #10-32 Low Profile Nylon Lock Nut
2 - Assemblies from Step #3
Connect the two MAXSwerve Module rails with two screws on each side so that each screw passes through a MAXTube Internal Support and the Nylon Lock Nut is on top.
Note - Leave the middle hole and MAXTube Internal Support empty, it will be used in a later step
Get:
4 - SPARK MAX Motor Controller
4 - Absolute Encoder Adapter
4 - JST PH 6-pin Extension Cable - 30cm
12 - WAGO 221 Inline Splicing Connector
Zip Ties
For each MAXSwerve Module, wire the NEO 550 and Through Bore Encoder to a SPARK MAX with an Absolute Encoder Adapter installed in the data port. Then, secure the SPARK MAX to the moduleâ€™s SPARK MAX Mounting Bracket using zip ties.
Note - Placing a zip tie over the Absolute Encoder Adapter and aligned with its notches is highly recommended to ensure a secure connection
Get:
2 - MAXTube 2x1 with Grid Pattern - Side C
4 - MAXTube Endcap - 2x1
8 - #10-32 Button Head Screws x 5/16in
Insert MAXTube Endcaps into both ends of the MAXTube with MAXPattern. Secure both MAXTube Endcaps with 2 screws, onon the top and bottom of the 1in face of the MAXTube.
Get:
6 - #10-32 Button Head Screws x 1 1/2in
Add this MAXTube to your MAXSwerve Drivetrain as the first middle brace. The factory edge, used as a reference in the above steps, should be mounted towards the front of the robot indicated by the green arrow.
