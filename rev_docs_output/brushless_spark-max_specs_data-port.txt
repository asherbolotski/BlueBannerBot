SPARK MAX Data Port Features
Limit Switch Inputs
SPARK MAX has two limit switch inputs that, when triggered, can independently prevent motion in both the forward and reverse directions. By default, when the pin for the corresponding direction is grounded, SPARK MAX will override any input commands for that direction and force the output into the neutral state. Input commands for the opposite direction will still be processed unless the corresponding limit signal is also triggered.
The default polarity is compatible with Normally Open (NO) style limit switches, whose contacts are shorted together when the switch is pressed. The Limit Switch Inputs can be configured for the opposite polarity using the USB or CAN interfaces. When configured for the opposite polarity, Normally Closed (NC), the limit will be triggered when the pin is left disconnected from ground. In other words, connecting the pin to ground will release the limit. The following table shows these configurations in detail:
Limit Switch Operation
Quadrature Encoder Input
The Quadrature Encoder Input on the Data Port is compatible with standard quadrature encoder signals, usually labeled as channel A, channel B, and Index. SPARK MAX shares these signals with the Encoder Port on the output side of the controller, therefore the Index signal is shared with the third brushless encoder signal C. When in Brushless Mode, these Data Port pins cannot be used with an external encoder. See
Alternate Encoder Mode
for information on how to configure the SPARK MAX to accept an alternative encoder source when running in Brushless Mode.
When in Brushed Mode, an external encoder can be connected through either the Data Port or the Encoder Port.
The SPARK MAX encoder signals are not pulled high internally. This is to ensure the maximum compatibility with different types of encoders.
Analog Input
The Analog Port on the SPARK MAX can measure voltages up to 3.3V with 12-bit resolution. The SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout includes a 5V to 3.3V amplifier circuit so that 5V signals can be sensed with the Analog Input pin.
Analog input is supported on firmware versions 1.4.0 and newer.
Multi-function Pin
This pin is reconfigured when the SPARK MAX is configured in Alternate Encoder Mode.
Power Rails
The SPARK MAX Data Port can provide both 3.3V and 5V power to connected devices. Please check
Data Port Specifications
for details on the supply current capabilities of both rails.
SPARK MAX Data Port Accessories
Alternate Encoder Adapter
Features
The SPARK MAX Alternate Encoder Adapter (
REV-11-1881-PK2
) enables the use of an alternative encoder source different from the default. This is especially useful when running one of the NEO Brushless Motors, as the default encoder port is occupied by the built-in NEO hall sensors. Please see the Alternate Encoder Mode section in the
SPARK MAX User's Manual
for more information.
