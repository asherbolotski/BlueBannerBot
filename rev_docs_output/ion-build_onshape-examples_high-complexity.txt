Drivetrains
West Coast Drivetrain -
Onshape File
This drivetrain incorporates two
2 Motor Drivetrain Gearbox - Through Bore
. Each gearbox drives two sprocket and chain systems to omni-directional wheels. This model utilizes the
NEO Vortex Brushless Motors
and
SPARK Flex Motor Controllers
.
The full BOM is available on the
product page
.
3in MAXSwerve Drivetrain -
Onshape File
This drivetrain takes advantage of four
3in MAXSwerve Modules
, allowing the robot the ability to drive forward and backward, side-to-side, and rotate simultaneously without sacrificing traction. In this example the MAXTube has been cut to a shorter length than what comes in the drivetrain kit.
The full BOM is available on the
product page.
Mechanisms
2019 Combined Mechanism -
Onshape File
Designed for the 2019 Deep Space FRC game, this mechanism uses a pulley system driven by NEOs to secure panels and cargo (balls).
2018 Intake -
Onshape File
Designed for the 2018 Power Up FRC game, this mechanism uses a pully system driven by NEOs to retrieve cubes.
Linear Actuator Arm -
Onshape File
Showcases the
Linear Actuator
as part of a liftable arm. In this example, the Linear Actuator is mounted using a
pillow block
to a
MAXSpline Shaft
on a
dead axle
to allow adjustable movement as the arm lifts.
