Kickoff Concepts
Over the last few seasons, members from the REV team have built different mechanisms to help teams get ideas and get started with building their robot for the year's given challenge. Starting at Kickoff, we start rolling out instant reactions, videos, prototypes, and other materials targeted specifically at the game. The concept videos aim to remove some of the frustrations when getting started without removing all of the challenge from FIRST. The challenge is a lot of fun!
