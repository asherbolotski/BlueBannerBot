The REV Hardware Client has three tabs to manage different features of the Client. The Hardware Tab is where supported hardware devices are managed. The Downloads Tab allows for the downloading of supported device software for updating when offline. The About Tab has information on what devices are supported, updating the REV Hardware Client, and having issue reporting.
Basic Tab
The Basic Tab is used to set the most common parameters for the Power Distribution Hub. You can also view and clear sticky faults here.
Sticky Fault - an indicator there was a fault that will stay until the fault has been cleared manually.
