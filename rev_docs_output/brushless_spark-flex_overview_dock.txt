Flex Dock Overview
The Flex Dock transforms the SPARK Flex (
REV-11-2159
) into a standalone motor controller, supporting REV brushless motors and virtually any 12V brushed DC motor by providing standard phase wire outputs. The 6-pin JST PH encoder port is compatible with NEO/NEO550 hall sensors in brushless mode and standard quadrature encoders in brushed mode.
Flex Dock
The dock securely mounts to a SPARK Flex using the same docking hardware as if you were mounting to a NEO Vortex. It features five #10-32 threaded mounting holes on a 0.5-inch grid, enabling versatile mounting on either face of the combined stack.
Additionally, the Flex Dock offers added protection against common faults caused by damaged motors or wiring. Compact and lightweight, it empowers you to adapt a SPARK Flex to meet your specific motor control requirements.
Flex Dock Features
Docks to Spark Flex with standard M3 docking hardware (not included)
Five #10-32 threaded holes on 0.5in grid with max depth of 0.25in for mounting
