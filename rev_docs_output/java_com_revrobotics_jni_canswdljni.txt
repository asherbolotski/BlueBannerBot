Method Details
SetSWDLDevices
public static
boolean
SetSWDLDevices
(int[] deviceIDlist)
Set the list of devices to update.
Parameters:
deviceIDlist
- The device IDs you wish to update as an array of integers.
Returns:
True if the devices were set successfully, false if there was an error
ResetSWDL
public static
void
ResetSWDL
()
Close, free, and reset the SWDL state. This is called automatically when the SWDL process
 completes or fails, but can also be called to reset the state if you need to start over.
IterateSWDL
public static
int
IterateSWDL
(
String
dfuFilePath,
String
binFilePath)
Iterate through the SWDL process, allowing for progress updates. Devices must be set before
 calling this function. This function should be called repeatedly until it returns 100% or -1
 (error). It resets state on error or completion. This function is not thread-safe, and only one
 thread should call it at a time.
Parameters:
dfuFilePath
- The path to the DFU file.
binFilePath
- The path to the binary file.
Returns:
The current progress percentage (0-100) or -1 if an error occurs.
ChecksumFailFramePresent
public static
boolean
ChecksumFailFramePresent
()
Check if the checksum fail frame is present in the last 5 seconds. A delay should be added
 before calling this function.
Returns:
true if the checksum fail frame is present, false otherwise.
