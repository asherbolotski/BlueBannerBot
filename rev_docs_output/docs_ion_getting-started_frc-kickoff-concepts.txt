REV Robotics is dedicated to helping robotics teams get a head start on building their robots for the current year's challenge by providing CAD models, videos, prototypes, and other materials. These concepts are designed to remove some of the frustrations of starting a new build season, while still maintaining the challenge and fun of the competition. The goal of our Kickoff Concepts project is to assist all teams, students, and mentors with ideas and resources to consider as the season progresses, regardless of their skill level or experience.
