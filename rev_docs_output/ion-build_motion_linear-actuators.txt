Linear actuators are a device that creates motion in a straight line, as opposed to the rotational motion of a motor. It consists of a motor, a lead screw, and a moving rod or shaft. The rotation of the motor turns the lead screw, this screw is threaded in a way that converts the rotational motion of the motor into linear motion, causing the rod or shaft to extend or retract. Linear actuators are commonly used in applications that require precise and controlled straight-line movement, such as climbing tasks, driving arms, actuating intakes, and deploying other diverse mechanisms. Their design allows for efficient, reliable, and smooth operation in various mechanical systems.

Motor Tables
The below tables provide the mathematical performance possibilities, and assume 1:1 gearing and 100% vertical load. Cantilever load and gear reductions will change these numbers. We recommend using a lead screw calculator such as the
AMB Robotics Calculator for Lead Screws
to find the numbers for your application.
