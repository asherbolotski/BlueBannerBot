Final Assembly Steps
Slide an UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly along one of the 15mm Extrusion - 420mm, until it sits just past the second Cross Member. Ensure that the pre-loaded M3 x 8mm Screws on both brackets are interlocked with the Extrusion slots. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Slide the second UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly along the Chassis Frame, so that the motor sits parallel to the motor from Step 6. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the Internal Chassis Frame as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The outer corner of the Lap Corner Brackets should be in line with the nearby Inside Corner Bracket.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the Internal Chassis Frame as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The edge of the Lap Corner Brackets should be flush with the end of the Extrusion.
Slide a 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Brackets until the Extrusion is roughly central to the center of the Internal Chassis Frame center.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the 15mm Extrusion – 420mm as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add two Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets to the 15mm Extrusion – 420mm as shown. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
The edge of the Lap Corner Brackets should be flush with the end of the Extrusion and the Lap Corner Brackets from the previous step.  Adjust the Lap Corner Brackets from the previous step if this is not the case.
Slide two 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets as shown. The ends of the Extrusions should be flush with the edge of the perpendicular Extrusion. Tighten Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to the Omni Wheel Assembly.
Add the 106 Link Chain Loop to the 20 Tooth #25 Sprocket on the Omni Wheel assembly. Add the 36 Link Chain Loop to the 15 Tooth #25 Sprocket on the Omni Wheel Assembly.
Slide the Omni Wheel Assembly onto the bottom side of the Chassis as shown above. Do Not tighten the Nylock Nuts on the Brackets.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to the Traction Wheel Assembly.
Add the Traction Wheel Assembly to the 106 Link Chain Loop attached to the Omni Wheel Assembly, so that the Chain is hooked on the 20 Tooth # 25 Sprocket. Slide the Traction Wheel Assembly into the Extrusions on the bottom side of the Chassis.
Slide the Wheel and Chain Assembly along the bottom of the chassis until the Omni Wheel is behind the UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly. Hook the 36 Link Chain Loop over the 15 Tooth #25 Sprocket on the UltraPlanetary Gearbox Assembly.
Note:
Adjust the Wheel and Chain Assembly until both Chain Loops are appropriately tensioned. Once adjusted tighten the Nylock Nuts on the Bearing Pillow Blocks until snug.
Repeat the previous steps until both side of the chassis have the wheel and chain assembly.
Add four Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets on to the ends of the four exposed ends of Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts.
Note:
The brackets should be approximately 15mm (the width of an Extrusion) from the ends of the Extrusion.
Add four Pre-Loaded Lap Corner Brackets on to the ends of the four exposed ends of Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts.
Note:
The brackets should be approximately 15mm (the width of an Extrusion) from the ends of the Extrusion.
Slide a 15mm Extrusion – 420mm into the Pre-Loaded Brackets until the Extrusion is through all the Brackets. Tighten the Nylock Nuts.
