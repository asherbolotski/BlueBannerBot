MAXPlanetary System
Static Load Ratings
The following torque measurements are for a static load condition. The torques listed are for the output of the stage.
Cartridge
Torque
3:1 Cartridge
Tested to 290 N⋅m (no failure)
4:1 Cartridge
Fails at 270 N⋅m
5:1 Cartridge
Fails at 240 N⋅m
1/2" Hex Socket Output
Fails at 250 N⋅m
Shock loads can cause the gearbox to fail in situations where the steady-state torque is still within allowable limits.
Cantilevered load on the output shaft puts additional stress on the gearbox and will reduce the torque the gearbox can withstand.
Cartridge Configuration
The following chart shows which gear cartridge configurations are allowable with different motors. Cells shown in
GREEN
are allowed and cells shown in
RED
are not allowed.
These ratings are based on the default current limit on the Spark MAX (or Talon FX). Increasing the current limit increases the maximum torque the motor can produce and may put components of the gearbox outside of their load rating.

MAX 90 Degree Gearbox
Static Load Rating
Gearbox ultimate strength - Failure at 180 NM +/- 5%
Please note that this is less than the MAXPlanetary Gearbox can withstand!
