MAXTube Extrusion
MAXTube
is compatible with the REV ION System and is a strong extruded aluminum tubing (Aluminum 6061) that features positional hole patterns that make robot structures easier to build.
MAXTube comes in
multiple extrusion profiles and wall thicknesses
.
MAXTube with Nut Groove:
On the 1in sides of these MAXTube extrusions, there is a nut groove inside to fit #10 nuts, making assembly easier by helping to retain nuts where a wrench can't reach.
Use Standard 2x1 Tube for a more secure bearing fit and 2x1 Light Tube where weight is a critical factor
MAXTube Hole Patterns
MAX Pattern
Some MAXTube features the MAX Pattern, combination of #10 holes in a 1/2in pitch grid and the MAXSpline bore every 2in. This repeats down the length of channel to mount bearings, MAX Hubs, shafts, brackets, and more.
Grid Pattern
2x1in MAXTube that features Grid Pattern has three rows of #10 holes on a 1/2in pitch. The Grid Pattern is ideal for rapidly prototyping structures with our 1in brackets.

1in Extrusion
The
1in Extrusion (REV-21-1000)
has slots on on all four sides that accept standard #10 Hardware, including low-profile nylock nuts. Rather than using a T-nut, which is more expensive,  slide a #10 hex head screw along the slot and adjust brackets and other build materials as needed. All holes in the 1in Extrusion can be tapped with a 10-32 tap, consistent with the REV ION Standards. The corners can also accept 1/16in thick flat stock.
The flexibility of T-Slot Extrusion makes using it a great option for builds that wonâ€™t fit on the pattern of your patterned extrusion. Teams are not locked into a pitch, so there are virtually infinite options for mounting other components. T-Slot Extrusion is also a great option for adding linear motion to your robot.
