NEO V1 Overview
The REV NEO Brushless Motor (REV-21-1650) is the first brushless motor designed to meet the unique demands of the FRC community. Offering an incredible power to weight ratio along with it's compact size it's designed to be a drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors as well as an easy install with mounting options.
Features
Drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors
Shielded out-runner construction
Front and rear ball bearings
High-temperature neodymium magnets
High-flex silicone motor wires
Integrated motor sensor
3-phase hall sensors
Motor temperature sensor
Wiring Connections
Connecting the NEO V1.1 Brushless motor is fairly straightforward. Follow the guide at
Wiring the Spark Max
, and don't forget to connect your sensor wire; the motor will not spin without it!
CAUTION: Improperly wiring the connectors can cause severe motor damage and is not covered by the warranty.
DO NOT
connect the motor directly to the battery.

NEO V1 Motor Curve
The only difference between the NEO V1 and NEO V1.1 are external changes to the motor's housing.
All of our motor testing was performed on our in-house dynamometer.
