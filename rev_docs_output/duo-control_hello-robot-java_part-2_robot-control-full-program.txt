It's time to bring everything together so to have a fully mobile robot! Returning to our HelloRobot_TeleOp program we can add our arm control to our loop below the drivetrain code.
Full Program
This program uses the same configuration file created at the start of Hello Robot. Some hardware may not be used during this section.

Right Stick vs. Left?
Which joystick is used for driving the robot is largely based on driver preference.
For Hello Robot, we will be referencing using the right stick due to the arm control using the Dpad. This can be changed at any time by changing from right to left in your
x = gamepad1.right_stick_x;
lines.
