Core Hex Motor Basics
The Core Hex Motor (
REV-41-1300
) is a motor that features a 90 degree orientation and a female output shaft for maximum flexibility and ease of use. Insert any of the REV standard
5mm Hex Shafts
into or through the Core Hex Motor to create custom length motor output shafts. The Core Hex Motor has a built in magnetic quadrature encoder which is compatible with 5V or 3.3V logic level devices including the Control Hub (
REV-31-1595
) and Expansion Hub (
REV-31-1153
).
Pinout
The Core Hex Motor uses a 2-pin JST-VH Connector for motor power and a 4-pin JST-PH for sensor feedback from the built-in encoder. For more information on using the cables and connectors included with the Core Hex Motor, see the
REV Control System - Cable and Connectors documentation
. The image below has the pinout for the motor power and the encoder.
Product Specs
Output Shaft: 5mm Female Hex
Weight: 7 oz
Voltage: 12V DC
Free Speed: 125 RPM
Stall Torque: 3.2 N-m
Stall Current: 4.4 A
Gear Ratio: 72:1
Encoder Counts per Revolution
At the motor - 4 counts/revolution
At the output - 288 counts/revolution
When to Use?
The general recommendation is to use the Core Hex motor for lighter duty arms and intakes.
Visit the
Choosing and Actuator
page to learn more about how the determine what type of actuator is correct for your mechanism.
How to Use?
To learn more about the built in encoders and wiring for the core hex motor visit the Control System Guide.
How to Mount the Core Hex Motor
The Core Hex Motor has two faces for mounting on two sides of the motor. The combination of the Motion Pattern is clocked to different angles on each face giving twelve different motor angles. The images below exhibit a basic mounting structure for two of the twelve positions that are available.
The images show a very basic mounting system. It is always advised to properly support elements of your robot with more 2 or more plastic brackets
