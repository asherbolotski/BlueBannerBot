This section outlines the steps required to build a mecanum drivetrain using parts from the FTC Starter Kit V3.1 (
REV-45-3529
), the 75mm Mecanum Wheel Set (
REV-45-1655
), and two additional UltraPlanetary Gearbox Kit & HD Hex Motors (
REV-41-1600
).
REV also offers a Mecanum Drivetrain Kit V2 (
REV-45-2470
) which contains the parts needed to build this drivetrain using Belts and Pulleys to transmit motion from the motors to wheels, rather than Chain and Sprockets.
This design is a good starting point. However, modification maybe required to address the specific needs of the robot being designed.
The assembly of this drivetrain is broken into a few sections. This allows for a team of people to work on different tasks to complete the build quicker. Each section begins with what parts and the quantity of parts needed to complete the steps in that section. A list of required materials for all sections is listed below.
