Structure brackets are designed to secure pieces of structure together at varying angles. There are different hole patterns available to accommodate the different extrusion types and patterns. In the REV ION Build System, structure brackets are any bracket that does not have a MAXSpline Bore.
Bracket Specifications
Material: Aluminum 5052
Thickness: 3mm (0.118in)
Grid Pattern: 5mm (0.196in) holes on 0.5in grid
1in Brackets
1in Inside Corner Bracket
(
REV-21-1203
) is designed to enable more construction strategies with the REV 1in Extrusion. Designed for #10 hardware, the mounting holes are on a 1in pitch that allows for the creation of complex joints by stacking with other REV 1" Brackets.
1in Brackets
(Product Family Page)
This is an assortment of Brackets that are all 1in wide and feature #10 clearance holes on a 1/2in pitch. Using these brackets with any of our MAXTube or Extrusion allows for easy construction of robot frames, mechanisms, and structure.
3-4-5 Brackets
Create a sturdy triangle with our 3-4-5 Brackets to support your robot. When using 3-4-5 Brackets any 3 lengths of tube that make a 3-4-5 triangle will allow the holes to line up with the brackets and for the holes to stay on pitch relative to one another.
There 3-4-5 Brackets come in both external and internal versions. Both brackets form the same structure of a 3-4-5 triangle, it is just secured in different places.
3-4-5 External
3-4-5 Internal
Use External 3-4-5 Brackets for creating a 3-4-5 triangle with 2x1in MAXTube that features the MAXPattern or the Grid Pattern
