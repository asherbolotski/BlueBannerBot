Control Hub Dimensions
IMU Location
When using the Control Hub (
REV-31-1595
)
or Expansion Hub (
REV-31-1153
) please note the location of the IMU in the graphic below. The Hubâ€™s orientation may impact the values received from the embedded IMU.
Wi-Fi Radio Location
The Control Hub has an embedded Wi-Fi radio for wireless communication. The antenna is located towards the top of the Control Hub itself. The graphic below shows the location of antenna.
DO NOT put a battery or other Wi-Fi blocking object on top of the Control Hub. This can lead to higher ping times for communication between the Control Hub and the Driver Station.
