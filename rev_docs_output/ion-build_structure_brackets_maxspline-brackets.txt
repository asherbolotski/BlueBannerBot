MAXSpline Brackets
MAXSpline Brackets
are compatible with the REV ION System and are designed to mount to pieces of 2x1in
MAXTube
- with MAX Pattern while maintaining proper pattern spacing.
In the REV ION Build System, motion brackets are referred to as MAXSpline Brackets because within the ION System, the MAXSpline shape is the core to transmitting motion. The major distinguishing feature of MAXSpline brackets are a MAXSpline bore, or a full MAX Pattern to support bearings and MAXHubs.
You can also use MAXSpline Brackets to mount motion components such as motors and pulleys, as seen below. A MAXPlanetary Gearbox fits perfectly on the 2in hole pattern of the Offset Mount MAXSpline Bracket (
REV-21-2351
).
A full listing of brackets is located on the
MAXSpline Bracket
product page. Compatible 1in extrusion brackets are also available on the
ION Brackets
product listing page
MAXSpline Bracket Specifications
Material:
Aluminum 5052
Weights:
MAXSpline Bracket - Stacked: 35g (0.08lbs)
MAXSpline Bracket - Offset Mount: 91g (0.20lbs)
MAXSpline Bracket - Parallel Top Mount: 49g (0.11lbs)
MAXSpline Bracket - MAX Pattern T: 39g (0.09lbs)
Application Examples
MAX Pattern T Brackets
MAX Pattern T Bracket
MAX Pattern T Brackets are ideal for creating a perpendicular joint of MAX Pattern MAXTube, as seen in the example below:
T Brackets securing two MAX Pattern pieces
Alternatively, the two MAXSpline openings allow for unique gearbox mountings, such as with the MAX 90 Degree Gearbox as shown here:
2 Motor Gearbox using a T Bracket to mount the MAX 90
When using the MAX Pattern T Brackets, the center to center distances of the MAXSpline openings will be offset.
Parallel Top Mount Bracket
Parallel Top Mount Bracket
The Parallel Top Mount Bracket can be used to provide support to the end of a shaft that may be cantilevered otherwise:

Offset Mount Bracket
Offset Mount Bracket
The Offset Mount Bracket is perfect for allowing a motor to be mounted parallel to the axis of a MAXTube:
Stacked Bracket
The extra row of holes on the Stacked Bracket can be used to tile the MAXSpline pattern on a MAXTube in 2D, keeping the holes and the spline on pitch with the mounting tube. The Stacked Bracket is recommended when the goal is to offset a motor from a tube while wanting to remain on pitch with the original tube spline openings.
