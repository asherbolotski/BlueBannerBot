Sometimes, when updating the firmware on an ION Control System Device, it is possible for the process to be interrupted or for the firmware to be corrupted by a bad download or other type of interruption in data transfer. In this state, the Status LED will be dark or dim and the device will fail to operate. There is a built-in recovery mode that can force your device to accept new firmware even if the controller seems to be bricked and the procedure is outlined below:
Performing this procedure will erase all data and settings on the device. Be sure to burn your desired settings to flash after recovering the device
