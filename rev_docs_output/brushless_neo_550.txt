NEO 550 Overview
The REV
NEO 550 Brushless Motor (REV-21-1651)
is the newest member of the NEO family of brushless motors. Its output power and small size are specifically designed to make NEO 550 the perfect motor for intakes and other non-drivetrain robot mechanisms. Mounting holes and pilot match a standard 550 series motor, allowing it to natively mount to many existing off-the-shelf gearboxes.
The REV NEO 550 Brushless Motor runs a 0.12in output shaft which, when combined with its 550-style mounting features, allows for easy installation in many off-the-shelf gearboxes.
Its small size and weight make it easy to put power where you need it, whether that is on intakes, end-effectors, or other weight-sensitive mechanisms. However, keep in mind that this motor has a lower thermal mass than a NEO, CIM, or Mini CIM, and thus it may not be ideal for some drivetrain applications.
Wiring Connections
Connecting the NEO 550 Brushless motors is fairly straightforward. Follow the guide at
Wiring the Spark Max
, and don't forget to connect your sensor wire; the motor will not spin without it!
CAUTION: Improperly wiring the connectors can cause severe motor damage and is not covered by the warranty.
DO NOT
connect the motor directly to the battery.
