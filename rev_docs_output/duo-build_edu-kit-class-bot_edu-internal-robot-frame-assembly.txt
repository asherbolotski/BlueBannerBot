Internal Cross Member Assembly
Slide a Pre-Loaded Inside Corner Bracket into the slot of a 15mm Extrusion - 225mm. Align the outer corner of the bracket with the end of the Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add three M3 x 8mm Screws to the slot of the 15mm Extrusion - 225m.
Slide a second Pre-Loaded Inside Corner Bracket into the 15mm Extrusion - 225mm. Align the outer corner of the bracket with the end of the Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add two Pre-Loaded Bearing Pillow Blocks to the 15mm Extrusion, as shown. The edge of the Pillow Blocks should line up with the end of the Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Internal Cross Member Assembly Complete.
Repeat steps above until
you have
two
Internal Cross Member Assemblies. Set aside for later.
45 Degree Assembly
Pre-load four Hex Cap Screws and Nyloc Nuts per onto the Holder plate  Battery Plate, as shown.
Once the screws have been pre-loaded onto the Battery Holder Plate, set the Battery Holder Plate aside.
Add a Pre-Loaded 45 Degree Bracket to a 15mm Extrusion  - 150mm- 45° Ends. The bracket should be set so that the vertex holes/screws are left exposed. Only 2 of the screws will be embedded into the Extrusion. Once placed tighten the Nylon Nuts on the bracket until snug.
Repeat this process to get a second,
mirrored
Pre-Loaded 45 Degree Bracket and 15mm Extrusion  - 150mm- 45° Ends assembly.
Note:
The part of the 45 Degree Bracket left exposed will need to have enough room to fit a 15mm Extrusion, in a later step. Before moving on to the next step consider using a spare 15mm Extrusion to test that there is room to fit another Extrusion on the bracket.
Add the two Pre-Loaded 45 Degree Bracket and 15mm Extrusion  - 150mm- 45° Ends assemblies to the Battery Holder Plate from the start of this assembly
.
Adjust the Plate so that both Extrusion pieces are in line with each other. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
In the example images the Battery Holder Plate is sitting at the base of the Extrusions. This is to ensure the Extrusions are level with each other. The Plate can be adjusted later to a different position if needed.
45 Degree Assembly Complete.
Set the assembly aside for now.
Internal Frame Assembly
Pre-load two Hex Cap Screws and Nyloc Nuts per onto the Holder plate  Battery Plate, as shown.
Once the screws have been pre-loaded onto the Battery Holder Plate, set the Battery Holder Plate aside.
Slide a Pre-Loaded Inside Corner Bracket into the slot of a 15mm Extrusion - 225mm. Align the outer corner of the bracket with the end of the Extrusion. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Repeat this process until you have two Pre-loaded Inside Corner Bracket and 15mm Extrusion - 225mm assemblies.
Add the two Pre-loaded Inside Corner Bracket and 15mm Extrusion - 225mm assemblies to the Battery Holder Plate from the start of this assembly
.
Adjust the Plate so that both Extrusion pieces are in line with each other. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Note:
Leave room between the ends of the Extrusions and the Edge of the Battery Holder Plate as shown in the image above. The space can be approximated for now and adjusted later to fit the Control Hub.
Add the Upright Assembly from above to the
Internal Cross Members
. Adjust until the Internal Cross Members are level with each other and the Upright Assembly is support on both Internal Cross Members. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Add the 45 Degree Assembly to the Uprights. As you are sliding the 45 Degree Brackets down the Upright Extrusions add two M3 x 8mm Screws to
both
15mm Extrusion  - 150mm- 45° Ends. The screws should be on the same side of the Extrusions as the 45 Degree Brackets.
Once the Screws are added slide the 45 Degree Assembly down the Uprights until the assembly is flush with the Internal Cross members. Tighten the Nylock Nuts on the 45 Degree Brackets.
Note:
It may be helpful when adding the screws to use gravity to your advantage
Lineup the M3 x 8mm Screws on the Internal Cross Members and 45 Degree Assembly so that a 45 Degree Bracket can be added to secure the assemblies together. Once the Bracket is added secure it with Nylon Nuts. Tighten the Nylock Nuts until snug.
Repeat until a 45 Degree Bracket has been added to both sides of the Internal Robot Frame.
Add two 15mm Extrusion - 225mm to the Inside Corner Brackets of the Internal Cross Members, as shown. The rest of the Internal Frame (i.e. the Internal Cross Member, 45 Degree, and Upright Assemblies) should be centered on each Extrusion.
Once centered tighten the Nylock Nuts on the Inside Corner Brackets until snug.
Internal Frame Assembly Complete
Set the assembly aside for now.
