The RGB LED located on the Control Hub (
REV-31-1595
) and Expansion Hub (
REV-31-1153
) near the RS485 ports and on the bottom of the Driver Hub (
REV-31-1956
) provide user feedback regarding the status of the Hub. Below is a Table of the Blink Codes.
Control Hub
All Control Hub Blink Codes assume the latest
Control Hub Operating System
is running on the device
Robot Controller Application 6.0 or Higher
If a Control Hub is running Robot Controller Application 5.5 or lower the LED Blink Codes for the Hub will be the same as an
Expansion Hub running Firmware Version 1.7.0 or higher
.
LED Status
LED Description
When
Hub Status
Solid Blue
At Boot
Control Hub has power; Battery is >7V and is waiting to initialize communications.
Solid Blue
Anytime
Hub is waiting for communication with the Driver Station Host.
Control Hub has power; Battery is >7V.
Solid Green
Anytime
Hub has power and active communication with the Android Platform.
Blinking Blue
Anytime
Keep alive has timed out. Fault will clear when communication resumes.
Blinking Orange
Anytime
Battery Voltage is lower than 7V. Either the 12V battery needs to be charged, or the Expansion Hub is running on USB power only. This fault will clear when battery voltage is raised above 7V.
This will not be overwritten by the keep alive timeout pattern.
Blinking Magenta
During Wi-Fi Reset
Control Hub changed Wi-Fi Band to 5GHz after pressing the button
Blinking Yellow
During Wi-Fi Reset
Control Hub changed Wi-Fi Band to 2.4GHz after pressing the button
