MAXHubs
MAXHubs
(Product Family Page)
provide a way to transfer torque to a MAXSpline pattern from shafts of various shapes and sizes. Other MAXHub variants allow for different bores or structural patterns to populate within an existing MAXSpline. MAXHubs are available in plastic and aluminum.
Check out our application example
Traction Wheel with Aluminum MAXHub
using two #10 Socket Head Cap 1-1/4in Screws and a Traction Wheel - 4in - MAXSpline - Hard (
REV-21-2424
).
