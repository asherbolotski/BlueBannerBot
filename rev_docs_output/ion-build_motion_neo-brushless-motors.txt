NEO Vortex
The
NEO Vortex Brushless Motor (REV-21-1652)
is a high-power, high-performance, and high-resolution sensored brushless motor from REV Robotics. It features a dockable controller interface that can be mounted directly to the
SPARK Flex Motor Controller (REV-11-2159)
or a
NEO Vortex Solo Adapter (REV-11-2828)
allowing control from any brushless motor controller, like the SPARK MAX. Its through-bore rotor is the heart of its unique interchangeable shaft system, facilitating easy integration with various robot mechanisms.
Features
High-resolution encoder
Integrated motor parameter and calibration memory
Through-hex bore with taper for numerous quick-change shafts
No motor wires - reliable and robust docking connections for motor phases and sensor
Dual sensor, direct contact winding temperature sensing
560KV (RPM per volt)
640 Watts (375 @ 40A)
#10-32 threaded holes on a 2in bolt circle
The motor and motor controller's silhouette fits behind a standard 2in rectangular tube
1/2in hex through-bore rotor compatible with any length hex shaft or application-specific Vortex Shafts:
8mm keyed
Falcon compatible spline
MAXSwerve with integrated key
7-tooth 20DP gear
MAXPlanetary input

NEO V1.1
The REV
NEO Brushless Motor V1.1 (REV-21-1650)
is the initial update on the first brushless motor designed to meet the unique demands of the
FIRST
Robotics Competition community. NEO V1.1 offers an incredible power density due to its compact size and reduced weight, and it's designed to be a drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors, as well as an easy install with many mounting options. The built-in hall-effect encoder guarantees low-speed torque performance while enabling smart control without additional hardware. NEO V1.1 has been optimized to work with the
SPARK MAX Motor Controller (REV-21-2158)
to deliver incredible performance and feedback.
Features
Drop-in replacement for CIM-style motors
Shielded out-runner construction
Front and rear ball bearings
High-temperature neodymium magnets
High-flex silicone motor wires
Integrated motor sensor
3-phase hall sensors
Motor temperature sensor
New to NEO V1.1
A tapped #10-32 hole on the end of the shaft, allowing teams to retain pinions on the shaft without using external retaining rings
A tapped #10-32 hole on the back housing of the motor, making it no longer necessary to remove the motor housing to press pinions
Additional holes on the front face of the motor for added mounting flexibility

NEO 550
The REV
NEO 550 Brushless Motor (REV-21-1651)
is the newest member of the NEO family of brushless motors. Its output power and small size are specifically designed to make NEO 550 the perfect motor for intakes and other non-drivetrain robot mechanisms. Mounting holes and pilot match a standard 550 series motor, allowing it to natively mount to many existing off-the-shelf gearboxes.
The REV NEO 550 Brushless Motor runs a 0.12in output shaft which, when combined with its 550-style mounting features, allows for easy installation in many off-the-shelf gearboxes.
Its small size and weight make it easy to put power where you need it, whether that is on intakes, end-effectors, or other weight-sensitive mechanisms. However, keep in mind that this motor has a lower thermal mass than a NEO, CIM, or Mini CIM, and thus it may not be ideal for some drivetrain applications.
Features
Mounting features match other 550 series DC motors
Out-runner construction (i.e. Rotor housing is compatible with REV Motion Pattern; you can mount metal
Gears, Sprockets, and Pulleys
)
Front and rear ball bearings
High-temperature neodymium magnets
