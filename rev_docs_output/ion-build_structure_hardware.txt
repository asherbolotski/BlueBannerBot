#10 Hardware Basics
The REV ION build system uses
#10 Hardware
to connect, or fasten, brackets and structure together on a robot. Different applications require different length screws. When attaching a bracket to extrusion, shorter screws are generally required. Use longer screws to connect Control System components and other thicker materials.
