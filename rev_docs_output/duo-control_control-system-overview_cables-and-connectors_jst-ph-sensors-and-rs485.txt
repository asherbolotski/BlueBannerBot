JST PH Connector Part Number Reference

Export as PDF
The JST PH style connector is used for motor encoder, analog, digital, I2C, RS485, and UART connections on the Control Hub and Expansion Hub. These are all 4-pin connections except for the RS485 and UART which are 3 pin. The connectors are keyed (they only insert in one orientation) and are friction locking. Below the keying feature aligned with the cable is shown.
REV Robotics recommends in most cases that teams use pre-made cables because the quality of the crimp is better when made using industrial tooling.  These cables can be bought directly from the REV Robotics Website or through other online vendors.
