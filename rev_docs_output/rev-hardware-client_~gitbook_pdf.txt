Fix overflow scrolling for some views that
Version 1.7.3
Display warning on Servo Hub device page when Servo Hub is in rs-485 mode.
Version 1.7.2
Add dropdown for configuring port disabled behavior to Servo Hub hardware page
Version  1.7.1
General improvements
Fixes viewing and installing software when offline
Improves the reliability of loading data from CAN devices
Adds a "Forget REV USB Devices" button to the "Don't see your device?" page
This button will prompt for administrator privileges, tell Windows to forget REV USB devices, and restart the REV Hardware Client
You will have to disconnect and reconnect all REV USB devices for them to show up again
This may not affect all types of REV USB devices, such as Control Hubs and Driver Hubs.
SPARK improvements
Fixes persisting parameters on SPARK motor controllers in follower mode
Version 1.7.0
Breaking Changes
The standard REV Hardware Client installer no longer bundles device software files that are under 5MB
If you need an installer that has device software bundled into it, download one of the offline installers linked at
https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client
Once a REV Hardware Client instance starts controlling a SPARK motor controller, no other REV Hardware Client instance connected to the same bus can control a SPARK motor controller until the first instance exits
The "Follow SPARK Using Preset" feature has been removed, in favor of simpler follower mode parameters in SPARK firmware version 25 and later
The "Burn Flash" button for SPARK motor controllers has been renamed to "Persist Parameters" to match the 2025 version of REVLib
The SPARK parameter
kSensorType
is no longer automatically-updated when the
kMotorType
parameter is changed
This only impacts SPARK firmware versions prior to 25.0.0, as the
kSensorType
parameter has been removed from later versions
The MAXSwerve Utility now requires SPARK firmware version 25.0.0 or later
General Improvements
Fixes issue where the installer could cause the computer to reboot unexpectedly
Improves the reliability of displaying and using devices on a high-traffic CAN bus
Fixes a performance regression in the 2025 beta release that affected CAN communication
Stops the Telemetry tab from breaking after a device that was providing data is removed
Fixes issue where Android devices that have a type other than "device" or "recovery" would cause device scans to take a long time and not include any Android devices or Expansion Hubs
Only allows one instance of the REV Hardware Client to be open at a time
Fixes an issue where Pneumatic Hubs and Power Distribution Hubs would be disabled when a SPARK motor controller is commanded to run
Servo Hub

SPARK Improvements
Adds support for SPARK firmware version 25
Improves UI for configuring closed-loop parameters (including MAXMotion parameters) on the Run and Telemetry tabs

Exposes individual faults on the Telemetry tab
Improves organization of SPARK signals on the Telemetry tab
Many under-the-hood improvements
Version 1.6.5 / 1.6.6
Version 1.6.6 was released shortly after version 1.6.5 to fix a regression where the Telemetry graph would disappear if you switched away from the Telemetry tab while the graph was running
Breaking changes
