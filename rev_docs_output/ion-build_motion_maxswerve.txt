MAXSwerve Module Overview
The 3in MAXSwerve Module (
REV-21-3005
) is compatible with the REV ION System, features a 3in Swerve Wheel, and is commonly used in a set of four to build a swerve drivetrain. This module gives a robot the ability to drive forward and backward, side-to-side, and rotate simultaneously without sacrificing traction. The 3in MAXSwerve Module uses the small size and low mass of the
NEO 550 Brushless Motor
and UltraPlanetary Gearbox to save a significant amount of space and weight.
Greasing Guide
When assembling the MAXSwerve Module we recommend adding grease during assembly and re-applying as needed for the maintenance of your mechanism. For most applications, using
White Lithium Grease
or
Red Tacky Grease
will provide sufficient lubrication.
