When docked with a SPARK Flex the NEO Vortex's phase and sensor connections are kept securely together. This eliminates intermediate wiring that can fail if not secured properly.
Docking Materials
Docking the NEO Vortex with the SPARK Flex is simple and only requires the following materials and tools:
NEO Vortex Brushless Motor
SPARK Flex Motor Controller
Docking Hardware
4 - M3 x 25 mm Socket Head Screws (included with SPARK Flex)
2.5 mm Hex Key
Docking Procedure
Follow these steps to ensure a secure and proper docking:
Ensure that power is disconnected from the SPARK Flex.
Align the motor phase bullets between the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex.
Allowing the bullets to guide the two together, press the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex together until their bodies meet. There may be a small gap between the motor and the controller opposite the bullets. This is normal.
Insert the included docking screws into the counterbored Docking Screw Clearance Holes on the SPARK Flex.
Using the 2.5 mm Hex Key, tighten the four screws evenly in a crisscross pattern until the screws are tight and secure. The screw heads should be sub-flush from the mounting face of she SPARK Flex. If you have a torque wrench, the ideal torque is 11.5 ±0.9 in-lb (1.3 ±0.1 Nm).
DO NOT
run the motor without the docking screws installed. These screws ensure a robust and secure electrical connection, and doing so may cause damage to the system.
Undocking Procedure
Follow these steps to undock the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex:
Ensure that power is disconnected from the SPARK Flex.
Completely remove the four docking screws from the assembly.
Gently pull the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex apart until the bullets release. Try to maintain their relative orientation to each other while pulling them apart.
