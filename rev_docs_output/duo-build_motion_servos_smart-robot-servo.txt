SRS Basics
The REV Robotics Smart Robot Servo (SRS) (
REV-41-1097
) is a configurable metal-geared servo that takes the guesswork out of aligning and adjusting servo based mechanisms. One SRS can be used as a standard angular servo, a custom angular servo, and a continuous rotation servo by simply changing its settings.
